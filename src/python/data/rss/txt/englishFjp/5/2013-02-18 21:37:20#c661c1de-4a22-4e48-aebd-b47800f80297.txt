FJP Welcomes Constitutional Court Decision to Amend Elections Law
Egypt’s Supreme Constitutional Court says certain articles in draft parliamentary elections law require changes before law is finally passed.
Hussein Ibrahim, Freedom and Justice Party (FJP) Secretary, welcomed the Supreme Constitutional Court's decision Monday for amendments to some articles in the draft elections law.
In a statement, Ibrahim said: "We respect the decision of the Constitutional Court regarding the Law on Elections of the House of Representatives.
"Prior oversight by the court, as adopted by the new constitution, ensures the stability of the country's legislative institutions and avoids negative impacts of prematurely disbanding parliamentary assemblies."
