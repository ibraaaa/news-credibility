Erian: Egypt Will Not Be Iran or Afghanistan
FJP leader Erian assures Egypt will not become like Iran, Afghanistan or Pakistan – with its mainstream tolerant Islam represented in the venerable Azhar mosque and university and its independent Church.
 Dr. Essam El-Erian, Freedom and Justice Party (FJP) vice-chairman, said: "Egypt will not turn into anything like Iran, Afghanistan or Pakistan. Egypt has its unique political and social development parameters".
In a post on his Facebook page, Erian added: "Egypt will remain free, united, independent and tolerant, with its historical Azhar, the oldest institutional university in the whole world, the custodian of Arabic language and religious sciences, and with its independent church upholding the law of the Orthodox faith as Church Fathers of old did".
