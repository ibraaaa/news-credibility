FJP Will Form Broad Government, If It Wins Majority in Upcoming Parliamentary Elections
The Muslim Brotherhood’s political arm, the Freedom and Justice Party, vows to form a broad-based government, if it gets a clear majority in forthcoming elections to the House of Representatives.
Hussein Ibrahim, Freedom and Justice Party (FJP) Secretary-General, said: "The FJP will seek a majority of seats in the new House of Representatives. I hope no political parties will boycott the upcoming elections."
During a press conference at the FJP annual conference headquarters, in ‘Six of October’ city, Ibrahim further said: "The FJP is holding dialogues and negotiations with various political parties for possible coordination or alliance. The results of these dialogues will be announced as soon as they are completed. If we get a majority in the House of Representatives, we will form a broad-based government".
On another subject, Ibrahim said: "We cannot accept Molotov cocktails being thrown at the Presidential Palace, hospitals and other state institutions and facilities".
