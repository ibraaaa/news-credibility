Hussein Ibrahim: Freedom and Justice Party Ready to Contest Elections; People Reject Violence
Those who shun democratic process are simply asking for the return of repressive corrupt regimes to rule Egypt all over again.
Hussein Ibrahim, Freedom and Justice Party (FJP) Secretary-General, said that the Egyptian people revolted on the 25th of January 2011 to reject guardianship and repression.
In a post on his Facebook page, Ibrahim said: "Those who reject ballot-box democracy are in fact trying to re-establish despotism, repression and guardianship of corrupt regimes all over again. Those who disrupt the interests of the people and terrorize peaceful citizens by adopting violence are indeed afraid to resort to votes in ballot boxes.
"We are determined to continue the march of democracy, and our party is ready to contest the first parliamentary elections after the adoption of the Constitution of the revolution."
