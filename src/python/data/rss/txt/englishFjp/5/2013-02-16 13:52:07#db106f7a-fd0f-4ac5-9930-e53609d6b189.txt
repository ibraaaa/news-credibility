Murad Ali: Freedom and Justice Party Will Not Get Dragged into Others’ Plans and Violence
While certain opposition forces get up to their necks in acts of violence and criminal vandalism, as well as schemes of treason and sabotage, the FJP seeks to help establish stability, law and order.
Murad Ali, Freedom and Justice Party (FJP) media adviser, reaffirmed that the FJP is determined to complete the building of state institutions in order to restore stability for the homeland and safety and prosperity for the people.
In a post on his Facebook page, Ali said: "Our approach is clear, with neither ambiguity nor hesitation. We are determined to complete rebuilding state institutions so the homeland secures stability and Egyptians begin to build their renaissance. At the same time, we are working to help the ordinary citizen to cross the severe economic crisis through services and activities such as the ‘Together, We Build Egypt’ campaign".
Ali further stressed that "No-one will drag us into violence. We will not respond to calls that aim to spread chaos in Egypt, as in Iraq and Pakistan.
"I know that some young people would have liked us to respond to those who use violence. But the wise impose their plan on their opponents, rather than act on their agenda."
