Katatni: Assaulting and Terrorizing Girls at FJP HQ is Disgraceful, Cowardly Criminal Act
Freedom and Justice Party chief Katatni condemns hypocritical parties and individuals who collaborate with thugs and old regime affiliates to destroy Egypt.
Dr. Mohamed Saad Katatni, Freedom and Justice Party (FJP) Chairman, demanded opposition politicians – especially, leaders of the National Salvation Front – to take a clear position against the attack by their supporters against girls preparing to commemorate Mother's Day at the FJP headquarters in Alrodah – Cairo.
In a statement on his Facebook page, Katatni said: "Unfortunately, some condemn violence timidly, then put their hands in the hands of criminals who assault our daughters and kill our young people.
"Attacking and terrorizing our daughters as they prepared for Mother's Day at FJP headquarters is a cowardly criminal act. What does a political dispute have to do with terrorizing and robbing young girls at gun point, or smashing up and stealing contents of party headquarters?"
The FJP leader affirmed that the party will not tolerate this attack, and that it will legally pursue the perpetrators of all the criminal offences involved, as well as those who incited them.
