Salafi Call Supports Freedom and Justice Party; Demands Investigation into Mosque Sieges
Powerful Islamist group ‘Salafi Call’ urges all parties, Islamist and non-Islamist, to show solidarity with the Muslim Brotherhood’s FJP against protest violence that threatens political life.
Salafi Call society said Saturday that yesterday’s anti-Brotherhood demonstrations stained with violence, "were shameful acts, requiring each party to assume their full responsibility before we get to the point of no return".
In a joint statement with Nour Party, Salafi Call demanded that both Al-Azhar establishment and the Ministry of Endowments should file official complaints with the Egyptian Public Prosecutor regarding sieges of mosques by unidentified suspects during Friday’s demonstrations, and called on all citizens to call authorities and provide descriptions of the culprits.
