Essam El-Erian: Muslim Brotherhood Will Serve Homeland Despite Troubles and Tribulations
As long decades of extreme and determined persecution, torture and execution in Egypt ironically helped the Brotherhood spread worldwide, now desperate acts of mindless violence will not derail its efforts to serve the homeland and the people.
 Dr. Essam El-Erian, Freedom and Justice Party (FJP) Vice-Chairman, said: "The violence I witnessed in the perimeter of the Muslim Brotherhood’s headquarters in Moqattam was as painful as the physical injuries it caused."
In a post on his Facebook page, Erian said: "The Muslim Brotherhood survived three kings (Fouad, Farouk and Ahmed Fouad) and four presidents of the first republic after the abolition of the monarchy (Naguib, Nasser, Sadat and Mubarak). As all these passed away, the Brotherhood remained steadfast, with its humanitarian and Islamic message getting stronger and spreading in more than seventy countries in six continents, all working with the same approach, complying with the law of their respective countries, for the benefit of their people, serving their respective homelands.
"Moreover, the Brotherhood survived the assassination of its founder, the martyr Imam Hassan Al-Banna, at the age of 42. The Brotherhood also survived decades of trials and tribulations in those regimes’ jails and detention centers, deprived of their constitutional and legal rights, while their children were hunted down and kept away from all centers of power or influence, from the army, the police, the prosecution service, the judiciary, the teaching professions, endowments and the media."
Dr. Erian continued: "The Brothers did not cower when their property and moneys were confiscated, time and time again, when their businesses were shuttered, or when they were chased out of their own homeland, nor did they succumb to continuous attempts to subvert their unity, disband their group, and sow discord in their ranks".
