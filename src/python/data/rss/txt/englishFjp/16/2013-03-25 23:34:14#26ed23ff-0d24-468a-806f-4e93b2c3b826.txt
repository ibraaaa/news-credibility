Muslim Brotherhood Vows to Respond Forcefully to Mokattam Violent Events with Legal Action
Despite deliberate violence, sabotage and savagery by old regime provocateurs and opposition thugs, Brotherhood leaders commit to patient and peaceful, yet forceful, legal action.
Dr. Mahmoud Ghozlan, Muslim Brotherhood leader, reaffirmed that the group continues its peaceful approach, and will not respond with violence to last Friday’s brutal attacks on its members.
"Rather, the Brotherhood will resort to reason and legal process, in order to uphold the law and its application on all."
In a statement to Ikhwanweb, Dr. Ghozlan pointed that the world saw the extent of the abuses the Muslim Brotherhood and its youths have suffered.
"Although Egyptian media ignored vicious attacks against the Brotherhood, photos and videos circulated on Facebook and YouTube reveal and document the crimes that targeted the group.
"The Brotherhood did not join the demonstration outside Cairo’s Media City or the headquarters of any political parties, although hostile media want to draw public opinion away from the evident criminality of the violence against us. We will not be distracted. We will not be provoked into violence, either."
