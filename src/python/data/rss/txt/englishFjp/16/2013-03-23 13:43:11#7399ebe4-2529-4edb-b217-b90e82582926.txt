Beltagy: Thugs and Militias Attacking Brotherhood Youth Outside Headquarters No Revolutionaries
There are ways and means to make revolutionary demands, none of which involve pistols, clubs or Molotov cocktail fire-bombs.
Dr. Mohamed Beltagy, member of the Freedom and Justice Party (FJP)’s National Committee, said that Friday’s attacks on Muslim Brotherhood youth are evidently acts of violence and savagery that have nothing to do with revolutionary action.
Dr. Beltagy refuted allegations regarding the reason of Brotherhood youth gathering outside the group’s headquarters, asking: "How would you respond, if thugs tried to break into your home and draw the dirtiest and most offensive obscenities on its walls?
"There are ways and tools to make political demands, to effect revolutionary change. What happened today simply has absolutely nothing to do with political demands or revolutionary work."
