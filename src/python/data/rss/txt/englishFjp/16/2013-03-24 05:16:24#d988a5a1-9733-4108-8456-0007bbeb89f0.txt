FJP: Refusing Elections, Opposition Willing to Burn Egypt in Alliance with Thugs and Criminals
In the absence of popular bases, community work, election platforms and clear vision, opposition parties would rather burn Egypt than go the ballot-box.
Dr. Murad Ali, Freedom and Justice Party (FJP) media adviser, said: "The crimes committed Friday, assaulting and terrorizing girls at FJP headquarters, and the obvious alliance with and use of thugs reveal that protests by certain opposition parties have nothing to do with disputes over articles of the constitution or election laws.
"Some people want to burn Egypt because they realize fully well they cannot achieve any victory through elections, and because they have neither the intention nor the inclination to offer serious programs or development projects. Their program is to drag the country into violence and destruction, their project is to thwart any attempt of development. All they do is pour insults, curses and obscenities."
