Muslim Brotherhood: Judicial Verdicts Must Be Respected
Egypt Brotherhood condemns ongoing violence in the wake of a court verdict sentencing 21 people to death for their part in earlier deadly violence.
 Dr. Ahmed Arif, Muslim Brotherhood media spokesman, said that judicial verdicts must be respected, and that any objections should be made through legal channels.
"Violence is condemned, totally intolerable. Maintaining security is the responsibility of the police – which is a civilian force that knows its national duties very well, away from political arenas. The police force has its rights and due requirements, also within the law, so it can work effectively, professionally."
