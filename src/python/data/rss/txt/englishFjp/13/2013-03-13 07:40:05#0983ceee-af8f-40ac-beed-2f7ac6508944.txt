Erian: Legal Since 1928, Brotherhood Will Update Status with New NGO Law
Although in 1928, Egyptian judiciary granted the Muslim Brotherhood legal status that cannot be impugned, stripped off or withdrawn, the group seeks to update its status soon.
 Essam El-Erian, Freedom and Justice Party (FJP) Vice-Chairman and head of the parliamentary bloc at the Shura Council (upper house of Egyptian parliament), said that Egypt’s new associations law will allow establishment of NGOs simply by straightforward notification, and that no authority will have the power to dissolve an NGO without a court ruling.
"The Muslim Brotherhood will further legalize their status according to the new associations law, as soon as it is passed. In fact, everyone is invited to legalize their status in compliance with the new law.
"While, the previous NGO law was arbitrary and unjust, the new one, already drafted after several rounds of community dialogue, grants all the freedom of civil action."
