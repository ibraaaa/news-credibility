Freedom and Justice Party: Rule of Law Must Prevail
Stressing that corrupt individuals are behind mindless violence in Egypt, the FJP urges all to maintain law and order.
 Dr. Murad Ali, Freedom and Justice Party (FJP) media adviser, said: Those who benefit from all the death and destruction, the riots and vandalism, are not simple citizens – workers, farmers or office clerks seeking for a decent life. Only corrupt individuals seeking to protect their misconduct and corruption benefit from ongoing thuggery and sabotage.
"Together, we made the great revolution to establish the rule of law, respect for the provisions of the judiciary, to ensure fair retribution. Regardless of acceptance or rejection of Saturday’s verdict, we must respect it. Legal process must be followed to challenge court rulings.
"I call on politicians, media professionals and members of the press to desist from frustrating the people and driving them to despair, using judicial verdicts to ignite the situation and drag the country to chaos and lawlessness. Everyone should reconsider their positions before it’s too late."
