Murad Ali: Decision to Suspend Elections No Crisis for Freedom and Justice Party
The Muslim Brotherhood’s political arm, the FJP, assures judiciary’s decision to halt parliamentary polls does not impact the party in any negative way.
Dr. Murad Ali, Freedom and Justice Party (FJP) media adviser, affirmed that Egyptian judiciary’s ruling to stop upcoming legislative elections does not cause any crisis or damage to the FJP, adding that all Egyptians must respect the role and judgments of the judiciary.
"This matter is not up to the FJP; it is for the Presidency to consider the administrative court’s ruling to stop the elections and to take a decision accordingly.
"The FJP will not be party to any appeal of the court ruling. The FJP is ready for elections whenever they are held."
