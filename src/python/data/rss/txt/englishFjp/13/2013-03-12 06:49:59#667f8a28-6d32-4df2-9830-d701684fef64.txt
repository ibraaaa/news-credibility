Heshmat: Parliamentary Poll Postponement Rekindles Political Reconciliation Hopes
Freedom and Justice Party leaders express hope that opposition will join presidential talks for national harmony and broad consensus.
 Dr. Gamal Heshmat, member of the Shura Council (Egypt’s upper house of parliament) for the Freedom and Justice Party (FJP), said that the Administrative Court ruling to postpone House of Representatives elections will give opposition forces a fresh opportunity to join political reconciliation talks through the national dialogue launched by the Presidency and attended by many parties in a number of sessions.
 
"Political discourses are not cast in stone; they change and adapt as circumstances change. Opposition forces’ continued boycott and rejection of calls for political dialogue can hardly be described as enlightened, patriotic or even democratic.
 
 
"Even in its seventh session, all options will be on the table in the President’s national dialogue already underway, with neither limitations nor preconditions.
"
Dr. Heshmat further pointed that the institution of the presidency complied with all substantive proposals made by opposition parties in dialogue sessions.
 
 
"However, the opposition's attempt to impose recommendations and decisions before – and as a condition for – attending dialogue sessions is simply unacceptable."
