Tunisia’s moderate Islamist Annahda party chief Rached Ghannouchi affirms that his party is endeavoring to expedite the country’s democratic transition.
Rashid Ghannouchi, Annahda Party Chairman, met Friday at the party’s headquarters with a delegation from the European Union headed by Stefan Füle, the European Commissioner for Enlargement and European Neighborhood Policy.
Füle affirmed the EU's support for the democratic transition process and legitimacy in Tunisia, stressing that the EU is ready to deepen the relationship with Tunisia at all levels.
Ghannouchi welcomed the EU delegation and expressed gratitude for the EU’s support to Tunisia during this period.
"Annahda Movement supports the deepening of relations with the European Union on the basis of common interests and mutual respect.
"Annahda Movement wants to take Tunisia out of this transitional period in the shortest time, after the approval of the country’s new Constitution which should establish democracy, uphold the rule of law and guarantee freedoms."
