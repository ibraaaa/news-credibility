Shehabeddin: Media Honor Code Embraces International Standards, on Dialogue Table Soon
FJP leader Shehabeddin affirms media code of conduct is being drawn up for discussion and public consultation within ten days.
 Fathi Shehabeddin, member of the Freedom and Justice Party (FJP) and Chairman of the Shura Council (Egyptian upper house of parliament)’s Committee on Information, Culture and Tourism, affirmed Monday that the Committee was close to finalizing a draft of the media Charter of Honor, which will cover all print and broadcast media, stressing that 75% of the Charter’s articles had been completed, and that it would be submitted within ten days at most.
Shehabeddin further said that the Committee would put the Charter for community dialogue so everyone would be involved in drafting a document that all workers in this field would agree and commit to.
"The Committee looked at a large number of international media charters and codes of conduct, including the BBC Charter and the Inter-American Press Charter, as well as the charters of a large number of European countries. We are determined to draw up a charter in line with all relevant international standards.
"The Committee will be issuing a report on the performance of the media during past months. The sub-committee formed for this purpose has almost completed its work."
Regarding the most important points in the sub-committee’s report, Shehabeddin said: "There have been many mistakes by the media in recent months, and the report describes the situation as a state of chaos and confusion."
