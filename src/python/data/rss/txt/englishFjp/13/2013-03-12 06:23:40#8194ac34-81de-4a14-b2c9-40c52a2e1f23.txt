Freedom and Justice Party Will Not Accept Police Substitute
While Egypt Muslim Brotherhood’s political arm, the FJP, welcomes public support for the country’s police force, it stresses that no-one can replace the force or take on its essential duties.
 Hussein Ibrahim, Freedom and Justice Party (FJP) Secretary-General, affirmed that the party still holds that the role of the police will not be taken by anyone else, pointing that help offered by any citizen is welcomed within the framework defined by the law for the purpose of establishing public safety and security.
"We will not accept that the role of the police is taken by anyone but the police. We have confidence in their patriotism and their ability to maintain security and stop any attempts to undermine the security of the country and the interests of the people, while complying fully with the rules of human rights."
