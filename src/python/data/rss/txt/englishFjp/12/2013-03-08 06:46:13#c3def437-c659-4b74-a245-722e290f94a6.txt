Muslim Brotherhood Students Win 54% of Contested Seats in Egypt University Elections
Brotherhood students run for 50% of their university union seats, and win 54% of those, as opponents take remaining seats, for a great diversity.
 Dr. Ahmed Arif, Muslim Brotherhood media spokesman, revealed that Brotherhood students won Egyptian university elections, taking about 54% of the seats they contested.
"Muslim Brotherhood students and allies participated positively in honest university polls, focusing only on 50% of the seats in student union elections, which they believed was best for the benefit of university students.
"We contested 4936 of the total 9680 seats. We did not compete for 100% of available seats. We won more than half of the seats we contested, that is 2653 seats, or 54%. Various other respectable currents took remaining seats. However, elections are still ongoing at some universities."
Arif added: "Undoubtedly, this diversity is good for all. It is in no-one's interest to have political polarization at Egyptian universities.
"Nevertheless, I am shocked to see some so-called opposition elites use certain ‘sensationalist’ media to spread incorrect information in order to vilify the Brotherhood and claim its popularity is declining."
