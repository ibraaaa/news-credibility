Legal Experts: Egyptian Detainees UAE Trial Mockery of Justice
A clearly political trial is set for Egyptians with no proper access to defense lawyers in a hardly-neutral court where verdicts cannot be appealed – a total tour de farce.
 Mukhtar Ashri, Freedom and Justice Party (FJP)’s Legal Committee Chairman, said that trials of Egyptians detained in the UAE without any legal basis make a mockery of justice and violate both local and international laws.
Earlier on Monday, in Abu Dhabi’s Federal Supreme Court, the trial of a number of Egyptians resident in the UAE started. They are accused of seeking to overthrow the government of the UAE. This has been postponed to March 11. Decisions or verdicts issued by the Federal Supreme Court are final, cannot be appealed.
In a statement to Ikhwanweb, Ashri said: "This trial comes in the context of an absurd political situation obvious to all. It also is an exceptional trial that promotes entrenched injustice".
Meanwhile, Abdel-Moneim Abdel-Maksoud, Muslim Brotherhood lawyer, said Egyptians detained in the UAE have in fact not been charged with any crime. They did not appear before the investigating authorities, and were arrested and placed in unknown locations. He called for orders to be promptly issued for their release, especially since they did not violate the laws of the UAE.
