Freedom and Justice Party Coordinates with Independents for Forthcoming Parliament Polls
The Muslim Brotherhood’s political wing, the FJP, endeavors to coordinate with Egypt’s patriotic personalities for ‘individual’ seats in the country’s next House of Representatives.
Dr. Khaled Hanafi Fahim, Freedom and Justice Party (FJP)’s new Secretary in Cairo, said the party would win no less seats in the next House of Representatives than it did in the previous People's Assembly of 2011.
"The FJP will contest the upcoming elections on its own, with full candidate lists, but will coordinate for ‘individual’ seats with independent political and social leaders, who genuinely care for the interests of the homeland.
"The FJP supports women and younger people, allowing them to exercise their role in the community, based on qualifications, skills and capabilities, away from quotas and numerical restrictions."
Dr. Hanafi further added that women have the time to connect to the community, and that young people have energy, vitality and capability, but must be trained and prepared politically and socially to make of them leaders who can work effectively in the public work arena to achieve the desired results.
