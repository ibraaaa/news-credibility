Freedom and Justice Party: Egypt Lives Important Stage of Democratic Transition; Seeks to Establish Rule of Law
Freedom and Justice Party Chairman Katatni meets with South Korean Ambassador, who is confident Egypt will get through the current bottleneck of essential transformation.
Dr. Mohamed Saad Katatni, head of  the Freedom and Justice Party (FJP), said that Egypt is determined to  establish the rule of law, as it goes through an important phase of  democratic transition, pointing that the upcoming parliamentary  elections, will represent a significant strategic shift in Egyptâ€™s  political life, security and economy.
During a meeting with South  Korean Ambassador Kim Yong-Su and his accompanying delegation at the  FJP headquarters in Cairo, Dr. Katatni said that Egypt is keen on  consolidating ties and deepening trade relations with South Korea as a  major partner, and that the FJP seeks to increase Korean investments in  Egypt in the near future.
For his part, the Korean ambassador  hailed the depth and strength of Egyptian-Korean relations, pointing  that Egypt is a great, most populous country, and that it will be one of  the most important economies in the world, due to its geographical  location and its tremendous material and human resources.
The  South Korean ambassador said: "I urge Korean businessmen to invest in  Egypt, just as the Korean company Samsung has been doing. Samsung is  opening up a new large factory in Beni Suef (on the River Nile, 74 miles  south of Cairo), in 2013, which will employ a large number of Egyptian  workers and export 80% of its production outside Egypt".
