Heshmat: Counter-Revolution Pre-Poll Violence Aims to Prolong Transitional Period
Freedom and Justice Party lawmaker Heshmat points that the same hidden hands stoke violence ahead of every election in an attempt to keep Egypt in the chaotic phase of transformation and thereby sabotage the revolution.
Dr. Gamal Heshmat, member of the Shura Council (upper house of Egypt’s parliament) for the Freedom and Justice Party (FJP), said that the atmosphere of lawlessness and chaos that prevails in some parts of Egypt now is repeated before every election to prevent stability.
"All the acts of violence and sabotage, and the attempts to overthrow the elected president by giving political cover for violence aim to restore the old regime and prevent the precarious transitional phase from coming to an end.
"There is thuggery, and there are weapons in the hands of so-called protesters. Political parties must refrain from lending political cover to acts of violence and vandalism. As for boycotting the elections, you need broad-based popular support in order for that to be effective."
Dr. Heshmat stressed the importance for the National Salvation Front (NSF) to participate in forthcoming parliamentary polls so it would win a sweeping majority in light of the declining popularity of the FJP and the Muslim Brotherhood, as the NSF claims.
The FJP lawmaker praised the safeguards offered to guarantee the integrity and transparency of the upcoming legislative elections, stressing that "the vote will be under full judicial and NGOs supervision and in the presence of delegates for each candidate. Sorting ballots will take place within polling stations. Also, great voter turn-outs are considered one of the biggest guarantees of the integrity of the elections".
