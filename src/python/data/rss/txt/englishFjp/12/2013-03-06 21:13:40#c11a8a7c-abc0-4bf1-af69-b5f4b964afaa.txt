Freedom and Justice Party and the Muslim Brotherhood: We Respect Rule of Law
Leaders and media spokespersons for Egypt Muslim Brotherhood and its political wing, the FJP, have expressed respect for the Administrative Court’s decision to refer elections law back to the Supreme Constitutional Court for final review.
Dr. Murad Ali, Freedom and Justice Party (FJP) media adviser, said that the party respects judicial rulings, adding that "the FJP will wait for the decision of the Supreme Judicial Commission for Elections (SJCE)".
Earlier on Wednesday, the First Circuit Court of Administrative Justice of the State Council, headed by Judge Abdul-Meguid Al-Moqanen, decided to stop the implementation of President Morsi’s decision to start procedures for elections of the new House of Representatives on four stages starting on April 21.
The Administrative Court further stressed the invalidity of the new Parliament even before it is elected, because the amended election law and the law of political rights were not referred back to the Supreme Constitutional Court before being forwarded to President Morsi for final approval.
Separately, Dr. Mahmoud Ghozlan, Muslim Brotherhood leader, affirmed that the group respects decisions of the judiciary and will have to comply with the rule, until an appeal is submitted, if any, or legal action is taken against it, adding that "Egypt’s Shura Council (upper house of parliament) acted fully and positively on the Constitutional Court’s suggestions for amendments on the election law. Referring the law back again to the Constitutional Court would have disrupted the elections process".
