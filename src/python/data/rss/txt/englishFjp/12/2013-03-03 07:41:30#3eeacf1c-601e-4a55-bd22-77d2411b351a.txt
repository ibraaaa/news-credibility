Freedom and Justice Party Leader Darrag: Kerry Cairo Visit Important
FJP leader Darrag hails US Secretary of State Kerry’s visit to the Egyptian capital Cairo as an important one, describing Kerry’s call to opposition parties to join forthcoming legislative elections as ‘democratic vision’.
 Dr. Amr Darrag, Freedom and Justice Party (FJP) Foreign Relations Committee Chairman, said that U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry’s visit to Egypt was a good step.
"This is an important visit that we believe is motivated by the US resolve to deal with the legitimate constitutional status quo in Egypt. The FJP believes that a balanced relationship with countries of the world, including the USA, is of paramount importance.
"John Kerry's call for opposition parties to contest the upcoming parliamentary elections is consistent with US belief in democratic process, and US concern that Islamists may otherwise secure a sweeping majority in parliament, even though we are keen that everyone should participate, and believe in the importance of forming a broad-based government."
