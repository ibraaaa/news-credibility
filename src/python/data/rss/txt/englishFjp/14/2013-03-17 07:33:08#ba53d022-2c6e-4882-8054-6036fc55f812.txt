Meshaal: Hamas Respects Egypt Security and Interests; Appreciates Egypt Military Sacrifices
Muslim Brotherhood Chairman Badie meets with Palestinian leader Meshaal to discuss vital issues for Hamas, Egypt and the entire region.
 Dr. Mohamed Badie, Muslim Brotherhood Chairman, met Saturday in his office with Khaled Meshaal, head of Hamas political bureau. The two leaders discussed the cause of Palestinian, and several important issues, especially Palestinian reconciliation, prisoners, Jerusalem, and the prevailing conditions in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
Meshaal assured Badie that Hamas and all Palestinians respect Egypt's security and interests, asserting that: "Hamas never interferes in Egypt's internal affairs from any angle whatsoever. In addition to its leadership of the Arab and Muslim nation, Egypt has always been the Palestinians’ strongest supporter in the past, present and future. Palestinians also appreciate the great sacrifices Egypt and the Egyptian army have made for them.
"I am in touch with various officials in Egypt, especially the presidential institution and the intelligence department. All points have been explained to them. Also, we are cooperating and coordinating with them to serve the Egyptian national security."
