Muslim Brotherhood Chairman Badie assures Italian Ambassador Egypt will successfully get across current rough times to stability and prosperity.
Â Dr. Mohamed Badie, Muslim Brotherhood Chairman, met in his office at the Brotherhood headquarters Sunday with Maurizio Massari, the new Italian Ambassador in Cairo.
Dr. Badie thanked the Italian ambassador for his kind visit, and stressed that the people of Egypt are undergoing an important phase in their history to rejuvenate institutions, values and policies thoroughly corrupted by the former regime, and also to achieve remaining goals of the Egyptian revolution.
"The Egyptian people have always proved that they can patiently go through hardships and overcome difficulties, and become stronger and more resilient; and they never forget those who stand by them in times of crisis. The future will certainly be bright and great for Egypt and its people, God willing."
