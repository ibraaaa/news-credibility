Katatni: Freedom and Justice Party Denounces Violence, Whatever Its Source
Freedom and Justice party chief Katatni condemns violence and vandalism, especially recent arson attacks on Itehadia presidential palace, and urges a quick investigation into beating of a protester.
Dr. Mohamed Saad Katatni, Freedom and Justice Party (FJP) Chairman, reaffirmed that the party rejects all violence, whatever its source.
In a post on his Facebook page, Dr. Katatni said: "While we condemn the attack on the presidential palace with Molotov cocktails, we denounce any violation of human rights and any erosion of the dignity of the citizen.
"I call on all politicians to refrain from giving political cover or justification for any violence. I also call on the Interior Ministry to quickly announce the results of investigations into the assault on a protester. We are grateful to all those who stood against violence. We also appreciate the Minister of Interiorâ€™s quick response, investigating the facts and conditions surrounding the beating of a protester."
