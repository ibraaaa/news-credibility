Ahmed Arif: We Will Not Join Or Call for Friday Demonstrations
Assuring that the Muslim Brotherhood embraces national dialogue as the means to resolve disputes and differences, the group’s media spokesman affirms that it will not take part in Friday’s demonstrations.
Dr. Ahmed Arif, Muslim Brotherhood media spokesman, said the group would not participate or call for demonstrations Friday, adding: "We will not be dragged into any confrontation or provocation, and will not go out to any ‘liberation’ squares. We have adopted a proactive mechanism in the form of the 'Together, We Build Egypt' campaign".
In a conference on results of the first week of the 'Together, We Build Egypt' campaign, Arif continued: "We want the language of dialogue to prevail. The various parties are bound to continue to have their differences. We may never be one single color. But diversity and difference should not lead to sedition and strife.
"We need a calm rational approach that does not confuse the issues. The Muslim Brotherhood embraces this vision of genuine constructive dialogue. Meanwhile, if anything caused tension, it is imperative that everyone come together so our political life would not disintegrate."
