Hussein Ibrahim: Freedom and Justice Party Will Cooperate with All for Egypt Security, Stability
Just before every major step Egypt takes on the path of democratic transformation, dark forces wage mindless, desperate wars against people and homeland, with bloody threats of violence and vandalism. Upcoming parliamentary elections are obviously no exception. Pure coincidence?
Hussein Ibrahim, Secretary General of the Freedom and Justice Party (FJP), reaffirmed that the FJP will cooperate with anyone who works for stability, security and dignity for Egypt and its people, regardless of affiliation or religion.
In a post on his Facebook page, Ibrahim said: "We really need to give priority to the interests of the country over intellectual and partisan agendas and narrow personal interests. Politicians and party leaders have to compete to offer programs to rebuild Egypt that can positively change the living conditions of citizens.
"Is it coincidence, though, that the repeated waves of spiraling violence and attempts to spread chaos and lawlessness precede each election event, where the ballot-box is the arbitrator?"
