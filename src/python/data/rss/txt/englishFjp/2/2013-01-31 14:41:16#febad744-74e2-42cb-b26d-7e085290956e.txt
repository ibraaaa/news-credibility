Muslim Brotherhood: We Will Not Meet Violence with Violence
Egypt’s Brotherhood reiterates its commitment to peaceful action under the Constitution and the law, even in the face of recent chaos and lawlessness that burned and destroyed many of its offices across the country.
 Dr. Mahmoud Ghozlan, Muslim Brotherhood leader, denied vehemently rumors published in Egyptian newspapers alleging that the Brotherhood has launched a 'White Bloc Islamists' campaign for violent confrontation with ‘Black Bloc’ militias.
"This allegation is totally unfounded. The Muslim Brotherhood adopts a strictly peaceful approach in its actions and activities. It works within the boundaries of the Constitution and the law."
In a statement Wednesday, Ghozlan denied ‘reports’ published yet again in Egyptian newspapers claiming that the decision to declare emergency rule came from the Brotherhood. He affirmed that these claims were absolutely baseless, intended to tarnish the image of the Brotherhood in the eyes of public opinion.
