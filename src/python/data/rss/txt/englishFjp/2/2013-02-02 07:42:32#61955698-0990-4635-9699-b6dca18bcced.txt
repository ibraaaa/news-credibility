Murad Ali: National Salvation Front Responsible for Providing Political Cover for Violence
FJP spokesman Ali is baffled at the National Salvation Front, which signed Al-Azhar dialogue with all Egypt’s political parties, pledging not to use violence, and then threatened continued violence just about 24 hours later.
 Dr. Murad Ali, Freedom and Justice Party (FJP) spokesman, described Itehadia Presidential Palace events on Friday evening as very unfortunate, especially after the signing of Al-Azhar document renouncing violence only 24 hours earlier, calling on opposition political forces to calm their supporters.
In a press statement, on Friday evening, Ali questioned the ability of the NSF to manage the country, if it is given the chance, criticizing it for providing political cover for ongoing violence.
He denounced statements tweeted by Dr. Mohamed ElBaradei, head of the Constitution Party, on his personal Twitter account, about the continuing violence throughout Egypt, stressing that the people's confidence in political forces has been shaken, adding: "Those who cannot direct their own followers, how can they rule an entire country?"
