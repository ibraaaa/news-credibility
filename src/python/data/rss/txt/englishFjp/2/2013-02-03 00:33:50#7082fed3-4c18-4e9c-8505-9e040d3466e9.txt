Helmi Al-Gazzar: ElBaradei Remarks Call for More Violence and Chaos
The National Salvation Front’s coordinator ElBaradei gives government ultimatum: either form a new Cabinet, to include a number of opposition figures like himself, or face continued violence and vandalism.
Dr. Helmi Al-Gazzar, Freedom and Justice Party Secretary in Giza, said that statements made by ElBaradei were an invitation for further violence, adding that: "He talks as if he is the ruler already. Who authorized him to say this: 'Either a new Cabinet or direct violent action'? He incites violence with such words, albeit indirectly".
In comments on private satellite TV channel ‘Misr 25’, Al-Gazzar denounced ElBaradei's position, saying: "He signed Al-Azhar non-violence initiative in writing, while he is involved in violence in reality. The Egyptian people now realize who is working for foreign goals and objectives alien to Egypt."
Earlier, Mohamed ElBaradei, coordinator of the National Salvation Front coalition, and chairman of the Constitution Party, said in statements on his Twitter account that violence and chaos are likely to continue unless President Mohamed Morsi and the Muslim Brotherhood meet the demands of the people.
