Ahmed Arif: Ongoing Violence Challenges Egypt’s Peaceful Revolution
ElBaradei, leader of the NSF, Egypt’s broad coalition of diverse and conflicting political forces, shows his hand, as he threatens continued violence, if a new Cabinet is not formed – perhaps including NSF leaders.
Ahmed Arif, Muslim Brotherhood media spokesman, said that acts of violence and vandalism unfolding outside Egypt’s Itehadia Presidential Palace represent a real challenge to the country’s great peaceful revolution.
"The National Salvation Front must stop providing political cover to acts of criminal violence, arson and vandalism, and refrain from using those as a pressure tool against the Egyptian President.
"All political forces must withdraw their supporters from the palace perimeter, in order to isolate and uncover criminals out to burn and destroy State institutions. Meanwhile, I must affirm everyone's right to protest peacefully without descent into violence and vandalism."
