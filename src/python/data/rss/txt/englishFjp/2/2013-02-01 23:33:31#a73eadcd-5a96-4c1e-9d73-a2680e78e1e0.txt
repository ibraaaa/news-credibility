Katatni: We Agreed Azhar Dialogue to Resolve Democratization Obstacles
Katatni lauds Al-Azhar initiative for positive dialogue among all Egypt’s opposition parties, groups and movements as the only way out of ongoing crisis of violence, chaos and lawlessness.
Dr. Mohamed Saad Katatni, Freedom and Justice Party (FJP) Chairman, said: "Today is a historic day, where everyone agreed, without exception, on an important document submitted by youth, penned by Al-Azhar, called for by politicians and public figures, in the presence of Egypt’s three churches, and which provided for full renunciation of violence in all its forms".
During a speech in a press conference held at Al-Azhar, after a meeting of political forces with the Grand Imam of Al-Azhar, Katatni further said: "The meeting discussed the fact that there is no way to solve the problems that occur in the process of democratization except through dialogue with no preconditions or restrictions. We will detail mechanisms, guarantees and agenda for this dialogue, which will cover anything that will enhance Egypt’s progress along the path of democratic transformation.
"I was pleased with the meeting called for by the Grand Sheikh of Al-Azhar and the spirit that prevailed as everyone sensed the danger and the responsibility. There was unanimity in condemning the violence and supporting action to stop attempts to spread chaos and lawlessness. I hope that this is the correct start to overcoming differences and establishing sound rules of political competition."
