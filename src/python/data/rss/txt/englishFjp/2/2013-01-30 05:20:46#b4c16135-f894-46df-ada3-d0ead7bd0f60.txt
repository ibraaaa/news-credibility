Justice Fathi: National Legislation Must Be Passed, Enacted to Confront Terrorism and Hooliganism
Egyptian laws must get tough enough to deter those who plot and carry out deliberate acts of violence, vandalism and sabotage, in order for the country to regain its security and stability.
Mohamed Fathi, State Litigation Authority Justice, affirmed that: "Measures taken by the Public Prosecutor, who ordered the arrest of armed groups involved in arson and destruction across the country is 100% legitimate and conforms to principles of Human Rights and the Constitution approved by the people in December 2012 referendum.
"We must all distinguish between peaceful protest and demonstration guaranteed by the Constitution and vandalism and burning of State institutions, which is punishable by law.
 
The Public Prosecutor’s decision was issued after prosecution service investigations with a number of suspects who admitted to committing those crimes."
Justice Fathi said that legislative action must be taken against terrorism and hooliganism crimes, as well as murder and sabotage of public and private property, including a requirement to remand in custody suspects of vandalism crimes until final verdict is issued.
He further stressed that special legislation should also be issued for attacks on prisons, police stations and government installations as well as private property.
