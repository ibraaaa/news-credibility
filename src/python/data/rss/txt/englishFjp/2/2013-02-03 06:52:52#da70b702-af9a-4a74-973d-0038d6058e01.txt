Al-Barr: Muslim Brotherhood Urges Political Forces to Compete in Service of All Egyptians
Muslim Brotherhood leader Al-Barr invites all opposition forces to shun mindless violence and engage in community service competition.
Â Dr. Abdul-Rahman Al-Barr, member of the Muslim Brotherhood Guidance Bureau, urged all political forces to compete in the service of the Egyptian citizen, pointing that the Brotherhood has already organized charity markets in which foods and goods are sold at discounted prices to help low-income people.
Dr. Al-Barr further pointed that, "These markets have resulted in a general reduction in the prices of some essential commodities such as meat in some areas. Also, a thousand schools were renovated. These efforts help support the government. This is the role the community can play.
"Muslim Brothers are raised to be helpful and supportive. Islam is a religion and a comprehensive way of life that commands Muslims to be generous."
