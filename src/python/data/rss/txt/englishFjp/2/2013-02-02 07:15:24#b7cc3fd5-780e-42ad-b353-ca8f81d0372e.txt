Hussein Ibrahim: National Salvation Front Responsible for Violence
It was certainly a sign of things to come when the NSF coalition of disparate opposition elements failed to call off its Friday ‘peaceful’ protests, even after its leaders signed Al-Azhar dialogue document.
 Hussein Ibrahim, Freedom and Justice Party (FJP) Secretary General, stressed that the National Salvation Front (NSF), which called for demonstrations Friday, bears the responsibility for the violence that continued late into the night on Friday.
In a post on his Facebook page, Ibrahim said: "Is throwing Molotov cocktails at the presidential palace now part of peaceful protests? Is this a measure of NSF commitment to Al-Azhar's pledge to non-violence? I have to say: everyone must indeed commit to stand united against violence and vandalism.
"The FJP is certainly committed to restraint. Its supporters will not go out to Itehadia presidential palace."
