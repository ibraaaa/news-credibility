Essam El-Erian: Interior Ministry Must Investigate Lynching and Torture Cases without Delay
FJP leader, Erian, stresses that using excessive violence against protesters is a despicable, intolerable crime that must be investigated quickly, bringing to trial all those involved.
Dr. Essam El-Erian, Freedom and Justice Party (FJP) Vice-Chairman, said frequent incidents such as – most recently – the lynching of Hamada Saber and the death of Mohamed Al-Gendi and Christie, in which members of the police are suspected of murder and torture, cannot be tolerated. No human can accept such crimes. They are a flagrant violation of the constitution and the law.
"In addition to urgent prosecution investigations, a fast-track inquiry must also be conducted within the Ministry of Interior, to hold accountable and punish anyone involved in the violation of the Constitution and the law and internal instructions.
"Reforming and purging the police force was and still is the most important objective of the January 25 Revolution. Indeed, Egypt is in dire need for security – but not at the expense of the freedom and dignity of its citizens."
He further added, "We realize the difficulty and danger of the task, especially for a force whose creed – established over long decades, since its inception – was to protect the ruler at the expense of the people, in the absence of democracy. The start point is the most important. I believe the new Interior Minister can effect the changes essential for reform. May God help him!"
