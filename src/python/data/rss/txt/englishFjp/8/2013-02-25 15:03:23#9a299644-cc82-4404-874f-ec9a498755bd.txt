Arif: Calls to Postpone Elections Replay Previous Attempts to Prolong Transitional Period
Since the fall of autocrat Mubarak in Egypt, certain forces have repeatedly tried to push the country back to the old tyrannical way of governance, absurdly rejecting the elected president, the approved constitution, consensus dialogue and - now – the legislative elections.
Dr. Ahmed Arif, Muslim Brotherhood media spokesman, said that some opposition forces’ claims of invalidity of elections and referenda, and their demands of postponing the legislative election are just a repeat scenario of what these forces have been doing persistently since the success of the revolution.
"These opposition forces should have been prepared to serve the higher interests of this homeland through those important democratic events.
"Agreeing to these calls of postponement may well keep us for years without a legislative assembly, without an elected government and without the achievements necessary for us to turn the page on the past and end the transitional phase."
In a statement made on Saturday, Dr. Arif added: "Despite attempts by dubious parties to force Egyptians to despair and shun every election or democratic event since the beginning of the revolution, the Egyptian people turned out in high spirit and unrelenting optimism and positively participated so as to move forward – to complete postrevolution institution-building".
