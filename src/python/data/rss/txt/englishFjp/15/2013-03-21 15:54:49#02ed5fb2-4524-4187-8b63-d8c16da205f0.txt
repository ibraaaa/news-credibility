Ahmed Arif: Muslim Brotherhood is Keen to Reconcile Legal Status
Egypt Muslim Brotherhood reiterates its resolve to legalize its status once a relevant law – currently being discussed by the country’s upper house of parliament – is passed.
Dr. Ahmed Arif, Muslim Brotherhood media spokesman, said that the group has several judicial decisions issued under the tyranny and repression of the former regime, proving the existence of the Muslim Brotherhood as a legal entity, and evidently refuting all absurd charges and accusations, pointing out that the Brotherhood operates openly and has nothing to hide.
"There are certainly question marks over the Supreme Administrative Court Commissioners’ report being issued at this time in particular. The lawsuit in question was filed almost two decades ago. We really wish to see this diligent, conscientious hard work in other pressing national cases. Meanwhile, we’ll await another ruling on March 26.
"The Brotherhood is determined to legalize its status. The now-dissolved People’s Assembly was just about to pass a new NGO law, which is currently being debated in the Shura Council (upper house of Egypt’s parliament). It is quite an old bill that did not involve but a small number of Brotherhood members."
