FJP Secretariat in Egypt’s Dakahlia governorate condemns hate calls to further violence and vandalization attacks on party HQs by hostile websites and individuals.
Freedom and Justice Party (FJP)  Secretariat in Dakahlia Governorate condemned a shooting attack on the  party's headquarters in the province, where a gun-totting thug opened  fire at the front of the building and fled the scene.
An FJP  Secretariat statement said: "At about a quarter past ten in the evening,  Tuesday, an unidentified suspect jumped out of a white Lancer car  (license plate 9874DFS), carrying an automatic weapon, and sprayed the  FJP Headquarters with machine-gun fire, damaging the building’s front,  entrance and balcony.
"The FJP calls on competent authorities to  assume their responsibilities and perform their duties, to put an end to  political thuggery. Hostile webpages and individuals who already  instigated attacks on FJP headquarters now incite more attacks against  us.
The FJP urges everyone to join hands and close ranks to  reject violence and support ongoing serious dialogue in order to help  save the homeland and the people.
