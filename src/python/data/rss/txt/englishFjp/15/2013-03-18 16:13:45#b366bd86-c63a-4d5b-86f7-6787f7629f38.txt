FJP Leader Emara: No Party Will Accept Humiliation and Violence Against Headquarters
Freedom and Justice leader Saad Emara assures the Muslim Brotherhood will not be dragged into acts of violence, despite all provocateurs’ attempts.
In statements aired by satellite TV channel Al-Mihwar, Dr. Saad Emara, member of the Freedom and Justice Party (FJP)’s National Committee, said, "We condemn all acts of violence by any party whomsoever, just as we condemn desperate attempts to lure Brotherhood into trouble it has been distancing itself from for long decades, determined not to go out to the street, to avoid confrontation and violence.
"Naturally, I condemn groups of men who drew graffiti of the dirtiest abuse cursing the Muslim Brotherhood right in front of their headquarters. This is not acceptable to any other party or movement."
The FJP leader pointed that since the revolution, all countries of the world have been sending delegations to visit the FJP and the Brotherhood, even before the presidential elections, stressing that the Hamas delegation is no different from other Arab, Muslim or European delegations.
In response to a question, Emara said that delegations in all countries of the world go on unofficial visits which do not necessarily include Presidential institutions or government offices.
