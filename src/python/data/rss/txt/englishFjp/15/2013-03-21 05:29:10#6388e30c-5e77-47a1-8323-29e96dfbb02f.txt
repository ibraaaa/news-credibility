FJP: Egypt Will Not Turn Back; Police Must Change Methods and Behavior
Stressing that Egypt will not turn back to oppressive regime methods, the Freedom and Justice Party affirms that the country’s police force must change the way it treats citizens, especially in custody.
 Dr. Murad Ali, Freedom and Justice Party media adviser, said: "Regardless of the truth of the charges against Gamal Saber, 'Lazem Hazem’ (Must Be Hazem) campaign spokesman, the insults and humiliation dealt to him during his arrest are intolerable, totally unacceptable.
"No authority, police personnel or individuals should ever insult and humiliate any citizen under any pretext. The police must apologize. Police personnel must change their behavior in dealing with suspects or detainees. Egypt has changed, and will not turn back to dark times."
