Muslim Brotherhood Students Favorite to Win Egypt Student Union Presidency
Muslim Brotherhood university students win confidence of a sweeping majority of Egyptian youths across all provinces.
Suhaib Abdel-Maksoud, Muslim Brotherhood students’ spokesman, said: "Despite media bombardment, vilification and deliberate misrepresentations, with elections so far completed in 17 universities representing 34 seats in Egypt’s student union, Muslim Brotherhood students’ candidate lists won the confidence of the great majority of Egypt's youth.
"Brotherhood student lists won 18 seats, including 55% of union heads and deputy heads of universities. These figures confirm that our programs and our vision is the closest to our colleagues – the students, and bring us closer to forming the next student union, God willing. This puts onto our shoulders more responsibility towards our colleagues throughout our beloved country. Meanwhile, we remain keen on the participation of students of all affiliations in activities within the union."
Abdel-Maksoud added, "In Al-Azhar University, the highest seat of Islamic learning, which represents nearly half a million students (male and female) in more than 77 colleges across Egypt’s governorates, students strongly supported the ‘Ultimate Victory Generation’ candidate list (Muslim Brotherhood students), giving them an astounding 100% win in Azhar university students union elections.
