Gamal Heshmat: FJP Defends Coptic Families in Libya; Will Secure Their Rights
Egypt Muslim Brotherhood’s political wing, the Freedom and Justice Party, affirms it is doing everything possible to help and support Coptic citizens in Libya.
 Dr. Gamal Heshmat, member of the Freedom and Justice Party (FJP) National Committee and member of the Shura Council (upper house of Egyptian parliament)’s Committee on Foreign Affairs and National Security, said: "We condemn crimes against Egyptians in Libya regardless of their faith. We are dealing with them as Egyptians, not only as Copts."
In a statement to Ikhwanweb Tuesday, Dr. Heshmat revealed that the Committee on Foreign Affairs and National Security held a fast-tracked meeting with Libyan officials, adding: "We discussed all issues relating to Egyptian families, including allegations of torture and murder, just as we discussed issues of Egyptian families in the UAE with relevant authorities.
"We reject torture and violence. We are trying to defuse current tensions. Meanwhile, we await Libyan investigation results. We will restore the rights and entitlements of any Egyptian whatever their faith. Ultimately, those who erred must be held accountable."
