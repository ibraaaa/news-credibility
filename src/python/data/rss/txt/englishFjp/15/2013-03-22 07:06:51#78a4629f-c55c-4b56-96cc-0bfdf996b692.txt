Mahmoud Hussein: Muslim Brotherhood Respects Journalists; Rejects Violence Whatever Its Source
While Brotherhood leader Hussein denounces all acts of violence, he condemns total media silence over persistent calls to attack and torch the group’s headquarters, of which 30 have been stormed by thugs.
 Dr. Mahmoud Hussein, Secretary-General of the Muslim Brotherhood, confirmed that the police are the main authority responsible for protecting public and private property, and stressed that it is the right of every citizen to defend their own life and property.
In a Muslim Brotherhood press conference Thursday regarding the latest attack on the group’s headquarters, Dr. Hussein added: "External protection of private property is a task entrusted to the police. We do not go out and attack anyone; but we will not allow anyone to storm our office and physically attack us.
"The Brotherhood rejects violence, whatever its source. We do not accept that a Brotherhood member attacks anyone.
Investigation authorities are responsible for establishing the circumstances of the altercations that occurred in front of the Muslim Brotherhood headquarters in Moqattam, in light of the reports and statements available to them. At the same time, the Brotherhood will conduct internal investigations into allegations of wrong-doing by any of its members."
The Brotherhood leader reiterated the group’s respect and appreciation of all journalists and media professionals, adding that it recognizes that individual abuses and violations do not represent all journalists.
"For long months now, certain parties have been persistently and openly calling upon their supporters to attack and torch Muslim Brotherhood headquarters, leading to the actual torching of dozens of our offices; but the media never mention any of that."
