Murad Ali: Opposition Election Boycott Threats Sure Sign of Failure
Freedom and Justice Party believes that, if opposition parties have any chance of winning seats in upcoming House of Representatives, they should not shun forthcoming polls.
 Dr. Murad Ali, Freedom and Justice Party media adviser, said that opposition threats of withdrawing from the next parliamentary election is the biggest proof of their failure to communicate with the masses.
"There simply is no justification for the opposition to boycott elections held under full judicial supervision, followed and monitored by the whole world, and watched by print and broadcast media that stand on the lookout for any ‘Islamist’ missteps; unless they are really worried about the world finding out the truth of their popularity – or lack thereof – on the ground."
