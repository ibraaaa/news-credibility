Katatni: Post-Revolution  Egyptians Will Not Allow Vote-Rigging
While in postrevolution Egypt government has no hand in managing elections, certain opposition politicians insist on forming a new Cabinet, at these critical times, before forthcoming parliamentary polls; and Katatni assures guarantees will be clear to all.
 Dr. Mohamed Saad Katatni, Freedom and Justice Party (FJP)’s Chairman, said that guarantees of elections integrity and transparency, whether legal or constitutional, are known to all; and judicial supervision of the elections has nothing to do with the government, “Active participation of citizens will ensure the integrity of the elections”.
During a national dialogue session held by the institution of the presidency in the capital Cairo, Dr. Katatni added: “Upcoming legislative elections cannot be manipulated, rigged or ‘faked’, because the people will not allow vote-rigging to take over their will ever again. The revolt against injustice will never allow fraud.
“A few days ago, I met a number of opposition politicians who demanded parliamentary polls be delayed, because ‘the right atmosphere for elections is just not there’; yet in the same breath they demand snap presidential elections. In fact, with the people in need of security and stability, changing the government would give a very negative impression. In any case, the government will have no hand in the elections.”
Further, Dr. Katatni demanded that there should be a media code of conduct, because the media may well be used as a tool to mislead voters, pointing that the performance of the media in the recent past makes it most likely to get seriously involved in propaganda and wrongful voter misdirection.
