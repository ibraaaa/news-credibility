Murad Ali: National Salvation Front Bears Responsibility for Demonstrations Violence
Desperately seeking to seize power despite failing at the ballot-box, Egypt opposition parties call daily protests that invariably devolve into mindless violence, vandalism and lawlessness.
Dr. Murad Ali, Freedom and Justice Party (FJP) media adviser, reaffirmed that the so-called National Salvation Front (NSF) bears the consequences of the demonstrations it called Friday and any acts of violence committed by protesters.
In a post on his Facebook page, Dr. Ali said: "The NSF has the right to call for demonstrations – although I completely disagree with the Front and hold that these demonstrations lead to further deterioration of the security and economic crises every time – but the simplest rule is that its leaders bear the consequences of these demonstrations they called and any acts of violence committed by participants therein.
"Every time the NSF organizes demonstrations, blood is shed, police are pelted with flares and fire bombs and attacked with bird-shot, and girls are raped or sexually assaulted, then NSF leaders turn up to simply condemn the treacherous crimes. If you cannot control demonstrations you call, let me tell you that you are 'failures' indeed."
