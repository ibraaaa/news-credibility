Azza Al-Garf: Brotherhood Condemns Tahrir Sexual Harassment, Respects Role of Women
Freedom and Justice Party leader Dr. Al-Garf rejects as utterly ludicrous claims made in certain print and broadcast media accusing the Muslim Brotherhood of inciting sexual harassment.
Dr. Azza Al-Garf, Freedom and Justice Party (FJP) leader, condemned absurd accusations leveled against the Muslim Brotherhood and the FJP and claiming they incited groups of thugs to harass and assault female protesters who join Tahrir demonstrations.
In a press statement, Ms. Al-Garf said: "Such accusation are utterly ridiculous and most disgusting, and are certainly not consistent with our code of ethics and Islamic reference in the first place.
"The Islamist vision and essential doctrine respects women’s status and roles in society, in business, at home and in the community. How can the Muslim Brotherhood be an advocate for these heinous acts which it has so often condemned?"
Dr. Al-Garf added: "We support the right of any citizen to express his opinions without breaking the law or attacking State institutions. Women are Egyptian citizens, just like men. They are entitled to express their opinions."
