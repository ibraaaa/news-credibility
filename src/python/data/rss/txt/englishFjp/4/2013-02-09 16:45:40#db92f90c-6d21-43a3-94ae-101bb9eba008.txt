Journalism Reform Movements Hold NSF Responsible for Violence Against Media Professionals
Following the latest attacks by thugs in Cairo’s iconic Tahrir Square on TV professionals covering Friday protest events, journalist movements condemn such repeated violent acts by demonstrators responding to NSF calls.
Journalists for Reform movement and Reporters for Change movement condemned attacks by protesters in Tahrir Square Friday where thugs beat fellow media professional Ahmed Abdul-Alim, a ‘Misr 25’ satellite TV channel reporter, while covering the events.
In a joint statement, the two journalist movements strongly denounced the continued targeting of ‘Misr 25’ TV channel and crew by National Salvation Front (NSF) youth and protesters in Tahrir Square demonstrations and sit-ins, noting that those protesters had previously assaulted media professional Mo’az Abdel-Raouf in Tahrir.
The journalist movements demanded that opposition forces must urge their followers to commit to peaceful protest in dealing with the media and journalists of all political or ideological orientations, and not to give any political cover for acts of violence and thuggery, stressing that the media and journalists were not concerned or involved in disagreements among politicians and that they were simply messengers of truth.
"Journalists and media professionals are keen to close ranks, away from political polarization, to confront the wave of violence and thuggery against the press and media – for criminals do not discriminate when choosing their victims.
"We demand the National Salvation Front (NSF) issue an apology through its representatives for all the harm that has befallen journalists and media professionals, especially since its leaders bear full political responsibility for all their repeated calls for protests across Egypt. We also call on the Ministry of Interior to arrest the perpetrators of these crimes in order to stop constant criminal threats against media and press professionals."
