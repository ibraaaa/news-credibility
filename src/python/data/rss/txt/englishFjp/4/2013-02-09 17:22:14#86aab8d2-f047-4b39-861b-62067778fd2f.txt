Farid Ismail: National Salvation Front Uses Political Violence, Extortion to Impose Own Agenda
The NSF holds Egypt hostage with increasingly violent demonstrations, vandalism and destruction to achieve its leaders’ personal purposes and dubious agendas.
Dr. Farid Ismail, member of the Executive Bureau of the Freedom and Justice Party, stressed that the National Salvation Front (NSF) bears full responsibility for ongoing violent events.
In a post on his Twitter account, Ismail further said: "The NSF takes the homeland and the people hostage with non-peaceful demonstrations to achieve its leaders’ personal goals. Employing violence for political pressure is a political and moral crime par excellence".
