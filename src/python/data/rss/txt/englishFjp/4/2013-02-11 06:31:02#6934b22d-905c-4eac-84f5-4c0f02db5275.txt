Yasser Mehrez: Muslim Brotherhood Played No Part in Torture
As one man claims Brotherhood took part in torturing a number of citizens in a Central Security camp, the group vows to sue him and all those who continue to wage a criminal campaign of vilifying and slander against it.
 Yasser Mehrez, Muslim Brotherhood media spokesman, rejected as unfounded claims that a few Brotherhood youths were involved in the torture of a number of citizens in Gabal Ahmar Central Security camps.
"The Brotherhood will sue the person who falsely claimed that its youths have tortured a number of revolutionary movement youths, resulting in the deaths of Mohamed Al-Gendi, member of the Popular Current.
"This person has made false statements to the Egyptian prosecution service. Brotherhood lawyers will therefore file a lawsuit against him. Evidently, the Brotherhood is the national faction most targeted by many quarters with deliberate vilifying campaigns."
In a press statement, the Muslim Brotherhood spokesman, appealed to prosecutors to apply the law, "because Egypt is a state of institutions. No citizen should be subjected to torture of any kind. Meanwhile, it is certainly most unacceptable for such a  campaign of deliberate rumors and lies to continue against the Muslim Brotherhood."
