Muslim Brotherhood Statement on Calls for Killing Perpetrators of Violence and Lawlessness
Muslim Brotherhood leader Dr. Ghozlan renounces calls by a certain scholar for killing of political leaders responsible for ongoing waves of total chaos, destruction and lawlessness across Egypt.
The Muslim Brotherhood denounce calls legitimizing the shedding of Egyptian blood and inciting murder, whatever their sources, just as it condemns the use of violence and vandalism; and calls upon all parties to safeguard Egyptian citizensâ€™ lives, blood, honor and money.
Dr. Mahmoud Ghozlan
