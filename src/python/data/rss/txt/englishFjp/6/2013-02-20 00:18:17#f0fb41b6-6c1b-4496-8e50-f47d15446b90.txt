Husseini: No Truth in ‘Brotherhoodization’ Claims; Egypt Needs All Muslims, Christians
Refuting baseless claims of a Muslim Brotherhood power grab, Husseini reaffirms that the group that gave Egypt its first elected President (Mohamed Morsi) has not taken but a comparatively negligible number of government posts.
Saad Al-Husseini, Freedom and Justice Party (FJP) leader and Governor of Kafr El-Sheikh (one of Egypt’s Nile Delta provinces), said: "Brotherhoodization of the state is a myth fabricated and circulated by some dubious figures. For one thing, there are 14,000 key leading positions in Egyptian government. Only 14 of these have been filled by Brotherhood members. Evidently, talk about Brotherhoodization is far from the truth. "
In a televised interview, Husseini pointed that only 5 of 33 deputy mayors belong to the Muslim Brotherhood, adding that: "The number of Brotherhood governors does not exceed 30%. What I know and personally believe is that every patriotic Egyptian – Christian or Muslim alike – who is expert in his field, must occupy his/her rightful place and serve his/her country and contribute in its development, progress and prosperity".
