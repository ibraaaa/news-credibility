Sobhi Saleh: Shura Council Fully Applied Constitutional Court Election Law Ruling
Egypt Shura Council acts on Supreme Constitutional Court observations regarding draft electoral law, adopting the Court’s ruling for a number of amendments to make it fairer to all.
MP Sobhi Saleh, deputy of the Shura Council's legislative committee, said that the Council carried out the amendments recommended by the Supreme Constitutional Court (SCC), thus fully adopting the SCC ruling’s text, content, wording and meaning.
In a statement, Saleh pointed that the Council amended paragraphs as recommended by the SCC so they are no longer unconstitutional. The council also acted on SCC recommendation to provide explanations for certain articles, he said.
He added: "Shura Council wants to provide an exemplar model for respect for the Constitution and the judiciary’s rulings and decisions.
"It is not the prerogative of Shura Council to refer the law once again to the SCC, according to Article 177 of the Constitution. That is the jurisdiction of the President, who has the right to pass the law directly or refer it to the SCC again."
Meanwhile, judicial sources within the SCC, said that Article 177 of the Constitution does not oblige the Shura Council to refer the election law to the SCC after adoption of its recommended amendments.
The same sources pointed that President Mohamed Morsi has the right to pass the election law without referring to the SCC again.
