FJP Urges Amendment of Elections Law As Suggested by Constitutional Court
Recognizing that there is no time to lose, in order to avoid putting back parliamentary elections, Mukhtar Ashri agrees to amendments suggested by Egypt’s Supreme Constitutional Court.
 Mukhtar Ashri, Freedom and Justice Party (FJP)’s Legal Committee Chairman, urged amendments to the elections law in line with the decision of the Constitutional Court.
Earlier on Monday, Maher Sami, Supreme Constitutional Court (SCC) spokesman, announced that the SCC issued its decision that some articles of the draft law on parliamentary elections were unconstitutional, and that the SCC will refer the draft law back to the Shura Council (upper house of Egyptian parliament) to make necessary amendments in line with the court’s decision. Sami added that SCC observations are binding for the Shura Council.
Further, in a statement to Ikhwanweb, Ashri added: "There is no time for postponement of forthcoming parliamentary elections. What the SCC says need amendment should be amended. We support the SCC’s decision regarding the elections draft law".
