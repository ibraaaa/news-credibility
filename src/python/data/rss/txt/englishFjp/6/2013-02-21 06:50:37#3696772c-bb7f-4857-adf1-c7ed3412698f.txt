Al-Komi: Public Protest Law Awaits Societal Consensus
More research and endeavors for broad-based consensus delay discussion of amendments to Egypt’s law of public protest and demonstration which is hoped to reduce the escalating violence recently witnessed in every ‘peaceful’ protest.
 The Committee on Human Rights, of the Shura Council (upper house of Egyptian parliament), announced it will postpone the discussion of the draft law on the right to organize peaceful demonstrations – passed to it for debate by the Ministry of Justice – until the greatest societal consensus is achieved on its articles, since most members are against its enactment at this time.
Ezzedin Al-Komi, the Committee’s deputy and MP for the Freedom and Justice Party (FJP), said that issuing the peaceful protest and demonstration law requires further research and discussion of the real reasons for protests.
“It is also hoped that a greater community consensus can be achieved through all-inclusive dialogue so the law is acceptable in the street. This requires a long time.”
