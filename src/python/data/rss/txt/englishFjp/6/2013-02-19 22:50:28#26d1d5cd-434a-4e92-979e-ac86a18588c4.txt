Heshmat Urges Diplomatic, Popular Solution to Crisis of Egyptians Detained in UAE
As UAE authorities are criticized for detaining Egyptians without charges, and in excessively ‘secure’ conditions, FJP leader Heshmat urges a speedy solution to the whole issue.
Dr. Mohamed Gamal Heshmat, member of the Shura Council (upper house of Egyptian parliament) and member of the Freedom and Justice Party (FJP)’s National Committee, said that the detention of a number of Egyptians working in the Emirates without anyone knowing their whereabouts, unable to contact their loved ones, is more like abduction than detention.
"Shura Council’s Foreign Relations Committee has demanded an end to this detention in a diplomatic, official and popular way. This detention must be condemned and apologized for.
"I appreciate the statement of the Organization for International Justice, in which it denounced the arrest of those Egyptians, demanded their release and considered them 'prisoners of conscience' because they have not committed any legal offense for which they deserve punishment."
