Turkey provides Egypt with doctors and high-tech medical equipment to set up fast-track medical centers across the country sure to improve general healthcare service.
 Mustafa Murad, deputy governor of Cairo’s Southern District, announced an initiative to review medical centers and hospitals in Cairo, in order to use existing sites for quick establishment of medical centers attached to these hospitals in coordination with the health directorates and relevant central departments.
Murad stressed that these will be rapid-response medical centers, a Turkish idea being implemented in Egypt. He added that Turkey has vowed to provide Turkish doctors to train Egyptian doctors, as well as modern, advanced medical equipment.
Some 300 medical centers will be built, after meetings with Egypt’s Minister of Health to regulate and organize the work of these medical centers.
Murad pointed that these centers will be highly advanced, with novel technologies and high quality service, and that each can be set up in just four days.
