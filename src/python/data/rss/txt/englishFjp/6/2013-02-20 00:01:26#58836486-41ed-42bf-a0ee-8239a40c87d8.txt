Erian: Shura Council Will Not Cause Parliamentary Elections Delay
Egypt’s Shura Council reveals that it has a set plan for fair division of electoral districts across the country, which means forthcoming parliamentary elections may not have to be postponed.
Dr. Essam El-Erian, head of the Freedom and Justice Party (FJP) Parliamentary Bloc at the Shura Council (second chamber of Egyptian parliament), affirmed that the Council has officially received the Supreme Constitutional Court (SCC) ruling on the Law of parliamentary elections.
On Monday, the SCC, headed by Judge Maher Beheiri, ruled unconstitutional amendments in texts of the House of Representatives and political rights laws, regarding articles on the definition of a ‘worker’, and the division of constituencies. The court also stressed that if a lawmaker changed his/her political affiliation, his/her membership would come to an end.
Dr. Erian said: "The FJP parliamentary bloc will abide by the SCC ruling. We will not debate the matter further. A comprehensive plan has been prepared by the Shura Council's Legislative and Constitutional Committee for the division of constituencies, taking into account all the observations made ??by lawmakers and political parties.
"The elections will be held as prescribed in the new constitution. The Shura Council will not cause that to be postponed. The court ruling is binding. We will comply."
