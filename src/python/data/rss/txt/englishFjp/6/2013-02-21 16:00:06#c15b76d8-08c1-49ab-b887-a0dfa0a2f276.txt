Erian: Senior Scholar Authority Not Involved in Legislation
Freedom and Justice Party leader Erian affirms that, according to Egypt’s new Constitution, the country’s Council of Senior Scholars plays no direct legislative role, currently entrusted to the Shura Council.
Dr. Essam El-Erian, Freedom and Justice Party (FJP) Vice-Chairman, said: "The Constitution expresses the conscience of the nation. Shura Council (the upper house of Egypt’s parliament) must act within the bounds of the second article in all matters without exception".
In a Shura Council session Wednesday, Dr. Erian further said: "Article 4 of the first postrevolution Constitution details Al-Azhar’s role and inherent competence. Accordingly, the Council of Senior Scholars cannot exercise the powers of legislation. That is the role of this (Shura) Council."
Dr. Omar Salim, Minister of State for Legal Affairs and Parliamentary Councils, said: "The Constitution provides for taking the opinion of the Council of Senior Scholars in matters relating to Sharia (Islamic law)".
