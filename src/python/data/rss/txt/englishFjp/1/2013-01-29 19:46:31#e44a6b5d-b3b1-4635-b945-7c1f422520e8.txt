Katatni Submits Initiative to Amend Parliamentary Elections Law
Freedom and Justice Party chief Katatni proposes in a national dialogue session at the Presidential Palace Monday ideas for elections law amendments aimed at defusing current crisis with opposition.
Dr. Mohamed Saad Katatni, Freedom and Justice Party (FJP) Chairman, submitted an initiative to amend the elections law, during a national dialogue session called by President Mohamed Morsi, who invited all national forces and political parties to attend on Monday.
In a post in his Facebook page Tuesday, Dr. Katatni said: "In the latest national dialogue session, and on behalf of the FJP, I proposed amendments in the elections law to calm current tensions.
"I hope all parties would rethink their positions and join us in confronting attempts to spread chaos and violence. At this critical moment, we must all rise above our intellectual and ideological differences and put the security and stability of this homeland above all else. Our hands are still extended to all for dialogue and cooperation."
