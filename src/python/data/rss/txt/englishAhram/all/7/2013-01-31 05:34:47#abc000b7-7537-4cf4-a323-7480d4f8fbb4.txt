New release: The Lost Revolution by Abdel Azim Hammad
Cairo International Book Fair (CIBF) to host a seminar on recently published book entitled "The Lost Revolution” by Abdel Azim Hammad, writer and former Editor in Chief of Al-Ahram newspaper
The culture café at Cairo International Book Fair (CIBF) is hosting a seminar on a newly released book entitled
by writer and former Editor in Chief of Al-Ahram newspaper, Abdel Azim Hammad, on Friday.
Hammad's new book highlights the conflict between symbols in Egypt. The helmet – represents the Supreme Council of Armed Forces (SCAF) – the beard – refers to the Muslim Brotherhood and the square – embodies the revolutionists' spirit.
He also discusses in the book the reasons that led to the letdown of Egypt's January 25 Revolution. Hammad reviews the inside scenes of the SCAF, the administration of Essam Sharaf, and the role of the Brotherhood and young leaders by recounting all events, conversations and interviews during this period.
The author was an eye-witness of the Egyptian uprising during his tenure as Al-Ahram newspaper Editor in Chief from 31 September 2011 to 19 February 2012, the day of his resignation.
Hammad's book argues that clashes in the dark between young people and the SCAF began because of the SCAF's major generals attempts to protect former president Hosni Mubarak from facing trial, which weakened the power of young revolutionary leaders and favoured the new alliance between the Brotherhood and the United States.
In the end, Hammad describes the revolution as 'lost' because the Egyptian uprising to destroy the unfair values of the old regime did not succeed to apply its own. Instead, the revolution gave power to others who also do not know how to correctly handle many of Egypt's issues.
