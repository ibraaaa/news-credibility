Egypt confiscates missiles smuggled from Libya
Two pick-up trucks carrying missiles smuggled from Libya to Egypt were intercepted by the authorities
An Egyptian security official says authorities have confiscated two pick-up trucks carrying 60 anti-tank missiles smuggled across the border from Libya.
The official says two truck drivers were arrested and the weapons seized just south of Cairo on Wednesday morning.
The two were heading from Marsa Matrouh, 430 kilometers (270 miles) northwest of the capital on the Mediterranean Coast, to the largely lawless Sinai Peninsula where weapons are regularly smuggled to Palestinian groups in the Gaza Strip through underground tunnels.
The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the press.
Lawlessness has been rife in Sinai since the ouster of longtime ruler Hosni Mubarak in February 2011. Weapons have flowed from Libya into the peninsula, where Islamist militants have grown in strength.
