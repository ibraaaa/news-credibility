Competition mounted between the 180 athletes, who competed as individuals divided by gender and also as groups of four, testing their strength, agility and coordination until one man, one woman, and one group was crowned with the title of El-Fit.
The crowd cheered as the judges announced that Amr Ismail took the title of fittest man in Egypt and Carina the fittest woman.
In the groups competition, the Nile branch of Gold’s Gym took home the title.
Many well-known names in fitness and wellness centres displayed their services throughout the day, and promoted their activities.
Apart from the El-Fit challenge, people enjoyed free sessions from different local instructors as well as a four-hour Zumba marathon.
There was something for all the family to do, including fitness video games, paintball, kickboxing, and yoga.
