Egypt football to show ‘new faces’ against Qatar
The Pharaohs to announce squad for Qatar friendly, Bradley confident of World Cup qualification
Egypt technical staff are finalising the Pharaohs' squad for Qatar friendly scheduled for 7 March and will announce it Thursday.
“The squad will combine new faces especially as the European-based players have apologised for the game,” goalkeeper coach Zaki Abdel-Fattah told Ahram Sports.
Egyptian champions Ahly approved the release of their players for national duty despite earlier rejection as the game is not approved by FIFA.
The winners of seven Africa Cup of Nations are bidding for their first World Cup finals since 1990 when they meet Zimbabwe in the African qualifiers on 26 March.
“I am sure Egypt players are capable of qualifying for the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. I can see enthusiasm and determination in the eyes of the players,” American manager Bob Bradley told media Wednesday.
The Pharoahs top qualifiers Group G with six points from two games, three ahead of second-placed Guinea. Zimbabwe and Mozambique hold one point each.
