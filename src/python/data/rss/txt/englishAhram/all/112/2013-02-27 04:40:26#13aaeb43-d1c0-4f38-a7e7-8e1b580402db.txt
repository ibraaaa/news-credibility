Zamalek keeper El-Shennawy ready for African Champions League game
Egyptian league Five-star Zamalek are finalising preparations for Africa Champions League game
Zamalek technical staff, under the leadership of Brazilian manger Jorvan Vieira, have announced their squad for Chad’s Gazelle in the second leg of the last-32 spot in the African Champions League scheduled for Saturday.
The White Castle’s solid goalkeeper Ahmed El-Shennawy has asserted he recovered from his knee injury and he is ready for the African game.
“I am all ready and fit for Gazelle and it’s the technical staff decision to start with me or not,” the 21-year-old goalie told the Cairo-based club official website.
Zamalek, who are delivering their greatest league performance since 2003 winning their first five matches, smashed their Chadian opponents 7-0 in the first leg.
“We will not underestimate our opponent and we will keep focused despite the 7-0 win,” El-Shennawy insisted.
Striker Ahmed Eid Abdel-Malek and defender Salah Soliman have performed rehabilitation trainings Wednesday as the duo suffer fatigue because of the team’s tight schedule.
Attacking Midfielder Hazem Emam has undergone scans on his hamstring muscles after he sustained a minor injury during the 2-1 Arab Contractors league win Monday.

Abdel-Wahed El-Sayed, Ahmed El-Shennawy and Mahmoud Hamdy
