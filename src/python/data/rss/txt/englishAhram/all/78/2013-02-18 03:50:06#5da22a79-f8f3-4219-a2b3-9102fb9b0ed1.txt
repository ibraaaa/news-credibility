2 goals: What more could we ask from Gedo, asks Hull City teammate
After scoring again in second appearance with Hull City, Egyptian star forward Mohamed Nagy 'Gedo' comes in for praise by teammate David Meyler
Gedo scored his second goal in as many appearances with the team to lead Hull City to a narrow 1-0 win over Charlton Athletic in the English Championship's second division on Saturday.
"Gedo's been fantastic since he arrived; he's brilliant," Meyler told the Hull Daily Mail.
"I spoke with [Egypt winger] Ahmed Elmohamady before he arrived, and he said he was very good," Meyler added. "You can see how hard he works; and he holds the ball up very well too."
"Most importantly for a striker, he's popped up twice with goals in the last two games," he went on. "They were two vital goals in our season; what more could you want from your striker?"
Meyler added: "I just hope he can keep scoring goals and we can keep on winning games. We've got a great opportunity."
The Ahly-bound 28-year-old player, who moved to Hull from the Egyptian giants on loan until the end of the current season, netted a first-half winner to continue his superb start, having also scored in the Tigers’ 2-1 win over Derby County last Tuesday.
Gedo's compatriot, Ahmed Fathi, also joining from Ahly, made his maiden Hull appearance after replacing Paul McShane in the 56th minute.
Gedo, later named 'man of the match,' put Hull in front after 33 minutes when he bundled the ball home from close range after Charlton goalkeeper Ben Hamer missed a corner.
Hull are currently second in the Championship table with 56 points from 31 games.
