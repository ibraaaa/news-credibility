Art Alert: El-Raseef inaugurates cultural space with Like Jelly concert
El-Raseef crew launches a new co-working and cultural space with a concert by music band Like Jelly on 20 February
Beit El-Raseef (House of The Pavement) will host several small opening events over the next weeks, starting Wednesday, 21 February with a concert by comedic musicians Like Jelly. The space in Maadi was built and renovated through the efforts of several volunteers and is currently open to the public.
According to their event information, the crew is planning to host a new activity each week to correspond with their publication El-Raseef Magazine's six sections.
The events will start with a music concert to reflect their section 'Khorougat' (Outings), which is a calendar of cultural activities. The next events, yet to be announced, corresponds with the sections: 'Maharat' (Skills) to pick up new skills and hobbies, and 'Shabaket Wasl' (Network Connection), which include organisations and people in civil society and community development initiatives.
The other sections 'Gomhouryet El-Tahrir' (Tahrir Republic) contains profile and opinion pieces on Egypt's current political situation, 'Hawadeet' (Stories), which feature anecdotes from Egyptian tradition and folklore, and finally 'Wasf Masr' (Description of Egypt) features travel stories from seldom visited areas in the country.
The space consists of a small handmade stage, screening rooms and a co-working community space for workshops and co-working by artists, artisans and members of civil society, along with a cafe.
Like Jelly will be playing their selection of satirical music pieces taking a critical, yet humorous look at Egypt
