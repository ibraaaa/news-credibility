Four Egyptian policemen injured in Sinai road accident
Truck accident in Egypt's restive Sinai Peninsula injures four Central Security Forces (CSF) policemen
Four low-ranking Central Security Forces (CSF) policemen stationed in Egypt's Sinai Peninsula have been injured after the CSF truck overturned as they were being transported to the Egypt-Israel border crossing for duty on Monday.
An official security source stated that the car transporting the officers flipped as a result of increased speed in central Sinai, according to German news agency DPA.  
The source clarified, however, the policemen were transported to the Rafah Hospital and are currently in stable condition.
In October 2012, a similar car accident took place killing twenty-one soldiers and injuring at least twenty-seven more.
