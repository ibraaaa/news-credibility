Egypt coach tips forward Gedo for bigger European club
Egyptian striker Mohamed Nagy 'Gedo' scores for the second consecutive game with Hull City and could join one of the biggest European clubs after his recent performance
Egypt's coach Bob Bradley nominates the Pharaohs forward Mohamed Nagy ‘Gedo’ for a move to one of the biggest clubs in Europe after his recent outstanding performances in the English Championship.
Gedo and his Ahly teammate Ahmed Fathi from the Egyptian giants joined Hull City on a six-month loan deal during the January transfer window.
"I was supporting the idea of Gedo’s move to England. He has the technical and physical abilities to shine there," Bradley was quoted as saying by Ahram Sport on Monday. "I expect Gedo could join one of the biggest European clubs if he maintains this form and discipline."
"Seeing a lot of Egyptian players playing abroad this season will be of a great benefit for the national team ahead of the anticipated World Cup qualifiers," the former USA coach added.
The talented 28-year-old hit man scored his second goal to lead Hull City to a narrow 1-0 win over Charlton Athletic in the English Championship (second division) on Saturday.
Hull City coach Steve Bruce has recently said that Egypt’s trio Gedo, Fathi and Ahmed Elmohamdy will play a big part with his team this season.
