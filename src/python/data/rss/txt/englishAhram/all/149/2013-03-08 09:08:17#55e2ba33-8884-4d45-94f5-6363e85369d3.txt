Ahly opt against signing former Fulham midfielder Tavares
Mickael Tavares fails to convince Ahly’s coach that he is good enough to join the Cairo giants
Ahly have opted against signing former Fulham midfielder Mickael Tavares after an unsuccessful trial, the club said on Friday.
The 30-year-old Senegalese, who left English side Fulham last January following a brief spell, has been training with Ahly for the past few days with a view to a transfer but he could not impress coach Hossam El-Badry.
“The technical staff was not convinced that the player would be a valuable addition to the club,” Ahly said on their official website.
The Red Devils are trying to fill the gap left by the departure of some key players and injuries to others, including skipper and central midfielder Hossam Ghaly who is suffering from a serious knee injury.
Ahly have made a stuttering start to their Egyptian Premier League campaign, losing two of their first games. However, they are only three points behind Group A leaders ENPPI, who played a game more.
