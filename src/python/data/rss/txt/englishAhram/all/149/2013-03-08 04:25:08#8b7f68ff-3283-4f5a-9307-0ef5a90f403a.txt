Egypt T-bill yields fall in end-of-week auction
Yields on six-month and one-year Egyptian T-bills slump by as much as 0.7 percent at Thursday auction
Average yields on Egyptian treasury bills fell once again after the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) successfully auctioned off LE6.5 billion worth of bills on Thursday.
The average yield for six-month T-bills fell to 13.26 percent, down from 13.33 percent at the previous week's auction.
The CBE managed to sell LE2.5 million of six-month bills, representing the total amount that had been on offer.
Meanwhile, the yield for one-year bills – of which LE4 billion were sold on Thursday – fell to 13.91 percent from a previous 13.97 percent at a 28 March auction.
