Cairo Book Fair extends to Saturday 9 Feb
The fair will close four days later than originally planned, hoping to make up for the recent political turmoil that kept readers at home and lost sales
The Cairo International Book Fair will be extended for four more days to close on Saturday, 9 February instead of its original date, Tuesday, 5 February, announces the fair organisers, the General Egyptian Book Organisation (GEBO).
Ahmed Megahed, head of the GEBO, along with the Egyptian Publishers Association, believe it will give publishers a chance to enhance their sales during these four extra days.
The fair was overshadowed by a surge of violence and turmoil that struck Egypt a few days after the fair’s opening, which dramatically reduced its visitors.
Egyptian publishers welcomed the decisions, but Arab-wide publishers are likely to leave the fair before the new closure date, due to shipment dates and their previous commitment to Morocco’s book fair, which opens in February.
