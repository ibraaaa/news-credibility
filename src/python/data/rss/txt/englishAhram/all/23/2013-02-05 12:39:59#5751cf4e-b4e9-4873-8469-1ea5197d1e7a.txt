April 6 to march for 'Jika' on Wednesday
April 6 Youth Movement and 'We Are All Gaber Jika' arrange separate marches on Wednesday and Thursday to demand justice for slain activist Gaber 'Jika' Salah
The April 6 Youth Movement is to hold a march on Wednesday to demand "retribution" for Gaber Salah.
Salah, 16, also known as Jika, was killed in November 2012 during protests on the first anniversary of the Mohamed Mahmoud Street clashes. He died after being shot in the head and chest with rubber bullets.
The marchers will condemn the "authorities' constant procrastination and their plans to file the case against 'unknown' culprits," the group said on its official Facebook page.
The march will set out from Talaat Harb Square in downtown Cairo at 5pm on Wednesday and end at Abdeen Court.
Meanwhile, the "We Are All Gaber Jika" Facebook page has called for a protest on Thursday at the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) to demand justice for Jika and other slain protesters.
