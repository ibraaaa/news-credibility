Iran, world powers to hold nuclear talks Feb. 26
Iran and world powers will hold talks over Iran's disputed nuclear programme on Feb. 26 in Kazakhstan
A fresh round of negotiations is to resume with world powers in Kazakhstan on February 26 over Tehran's disputed nuclear activities, Iran's state news agency IRNA reported on Tuesday.  However, the statement did not specify which Kazakh city would host the talks.
Iran's Supreme National Security Council announced an agreement had been made during a telephone conversation on Tuesday between Ali Bagheri, Iran's deputy nuclear negotiator, and his European Union counterpart Helga Schmid as to the date and venue of their coming talks.
Iran is engaged in a stand-off with the United States and some of its Western allies, who believe Tehran may be trying to develop weapons capability under the cover of a civilian nuclear programme.
Iran has repeatedly denied that is its intention, and has met with world powers, dubbed the P5+1, several times for negotiations but the talks have stalled since a round held last June in Moscow.
