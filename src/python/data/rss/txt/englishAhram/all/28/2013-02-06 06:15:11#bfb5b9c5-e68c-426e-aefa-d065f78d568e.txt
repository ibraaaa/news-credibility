Bayern Munich to face Barcelona in July charity game
The former Barcelona coach, Guardiola, recently agreed a a three-year deal with the Bavarian giants
Bayern Munich will take on Barcelona in a high-profile charity game in Munich in July with the Spanish side's former coach Pep Guardiola sitting on the German bench, the Bundesliga leaders said on Wednesday.
Guardiola agreed to a three-year deal with Bayern last month and will take over from Jupp Heynckes at the end of the season.
He stepped down as Barca coach at the end of last term after leading the La Liga club, where he began his career as a player, to 14 trophies in four years, including two Champions League crowns and three Spanish league titles in a row.
Bayern CEO Karl-Heinz Rummenigge and Barca President Sandro Rosell sealed the deal for the game, marking Bayern boss Uli Hoeness' 60th birthday and with all proceeds going to charity, in a meeting in Doha on Wednesday.
