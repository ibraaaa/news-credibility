FIFA adviser Pieth slams UEFA blocking tactics
FIFA anti-corruption adviser Mark Pieth says European officials are blocking reforms in world soccer to further their own careers.
Pieth tells the Associated Press he is ''disappointed with what UEFA is coming out with, with the help of the British and the Germans.''
The Swiss law professor says countries ''making big noises in the past'' when FIFA was rocked by bribery and vote-buying allegations are not pressing hard enough for change.
Pieth says UEFA President Michel Platini is trying to silence countries with ''unanimous declarations'' on their behalf.
UEFA's formal proposal in FIFA's global consultation is ''basically trying to cut half'' of the modernizing agenda set by Pieth's panel, he says.
Pieth spoke in Geneva before a Feb. 26 meeting of FIFA's working group that will help shape reforms.
