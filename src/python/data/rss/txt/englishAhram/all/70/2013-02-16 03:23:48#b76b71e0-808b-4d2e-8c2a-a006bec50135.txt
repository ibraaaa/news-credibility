Egypt’s Zamalek yearn for fan support in Champions League tie
Zamalek open their African Champions League campaign against Chad’s Gazelle FC in Alexandria on Sunday
Zamalek will finally have their fans back to the stands when they host Chad’s Gazelle FC in the first leg of the African Champions League preliminary round on Sunday.
The game will take place at the 86,000-seat Egyptian Army Stadium in Borg El-Arab, Alexandria, but only up to 5,000 spectators would be able to attend the match.
Domestic matches are still being played behind closed doors due to security concerns but Egyptian authorities have allowed limited fan attendance in continental encounters.
“Zamalek are in a desperate need of the support of their fans in the game. The fans will be equally eager to watch the players in action from the stands,” chairman Mamdouh Abbas said on the club’s official website.
“We have to take into consideration the security aspects of that match, which we want to pass peacefully to avoid any financial or moral losses.
“The fans’ presence is crucial, that’s why everyone is now calling on the authorities to review their decision to stage the league matches behind closed doors,” added the wealthy businessman.
Zamalek last played before their fans when they drew 1-1 with Ghana’s Berekum Chelsea in the Champions League group stage last year.
The club won the last of their five Champions League titles in 2002.
