Dana Gas says starts output from two Egypt gas fields
Emirate Dana Gas announces gas production rise in Egypt and plans to start up operations in a new field in the first half of 2013
Dana Gas has increased its gas production in Egypt by about 10 percent with the start up of commercial operations at two fields, the United Arab Emirates-based company said onTuesday.
The West Sama-1 and Allium-1 fields in Egypt have started less than two months after initial well testing was conducted, Dana Gas said in a statement.
"The wells increase our production by 20 million cubic feet per day, providing much needed additional production to the
Egyptian market and maintaining vital supplies of gas for power generation," Rashid Al Jarwan, the company's acting chief executive, said.
Dana Gas plans to bring another field, Balsam-1, into production in the first half of 2013.
