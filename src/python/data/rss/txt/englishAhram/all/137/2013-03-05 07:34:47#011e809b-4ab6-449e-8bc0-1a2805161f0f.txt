Ivory Coast's Cheick Tiote claims referees target him
The Newcastle midfielder believes referees target him because he received many yellow cards in the English Premier League
 After picking up his 11
yellow card of this season last weekend, Newcastle's Ivorian midfielder Cheick Tiote said his reputation made him an easy target for referees.
Tiote, who has collected 36 yellows and two reds in 70 appearances for Newcastle since joining in the summer of 2010, was booked during Newcastle's defeat by Swansea but the TV replays suggested that he had made no contact with the opposing player.
"I don't know why I was booked. I tried to take the ball but I didn't touch anyone," Tiote was quoted as saying by Sky Sports.
"The referee made a though decision  and I have to accept that.
"I think sometimes I get punished because people know I have a lot of bookings already in England. I think sometimes this happens. On Saturday I wasn't at fault but I got a booking. That's football though, I just need to concentrate on my game and not let it affect me.
"I think my discipline is better now than last season. I need to keep doing the same things and to continue to improve in that way," he added.
