Tennis: Berdych upsets Federer to reach Dubai final
Defending champion Roger Federer out of Dubai Championships after losing to Berdych in the semifinals on Friday
Tomas Berdych saved three match points and upset defending champion Roger Federer 3-6, 7-6 (8), 6-4 Friday to earn a place in the Dubai Championships final against Novak Djokovic.
In the tiebreaker, Berdych led 4-2 before needing to save two match points - the second with a powerful serve. The Czech player then wasted a set point before Federer failed to convert his third match point. Berdych finally clinched the set with a blistering return.
The second-ranked Federer hasn't reached a final in 2013.
Earlier, Djokovic rallied past fourth-seeded Juan Martin del Potro 6-3, 7-6 (4).
