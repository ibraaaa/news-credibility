VIDEO: Egyptians do the Harlem Shake outside Muslim Brotherhood HQ in Cairo
Egyptians motivated by 'boredom' dance Harlem Shake in front of Islamist group's headquarters in Moqattam, Cairo
Dozens of young men and women put on a public 'Harlem Shake' performance in front of the Muslim Brotherhood's national headquarters in Cairo's Moqattam district on Thursday.
A two and a half minute YouTube video shows the young Egyptians dancing to different kinds of music, not just the Harlem Shake song.
Some of the dancers wore "V for Vendetta" Guy Fawkes masks.
The event was organised on Facebook and motivated by "boredom."
The global dance craze started on 2 February when a group of Australian teens uploaded a 31-second clip of themselves dancing to Harlem Shake by electronic musician Baauer.
The Muslim Brotherhood and its political wing, the Freedom and Justice Party (FJP), has been facing growing criticism since the second anniversary of the January 25 Revolution.
A number of FJP offices around the country have been attacked or torched by demonstrators in the past two months.
Recently, a number of activists organised a football tournament in front of the Brotherhood’s headquarters under the banner “glory to the martyrs."
