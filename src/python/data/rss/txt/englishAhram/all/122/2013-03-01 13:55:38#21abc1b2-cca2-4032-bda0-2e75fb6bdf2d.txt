Juventus have title in sight after 1-1 draw with Napoli
Juventus held to a 1-1 draw with Napoli in the 27th matchday of the Italian Serie A on Friday
Serie A leader Juventus drew 1-1 at Napoli in a tense top-of-the-table match Friday that could clear the way for the Turin club to win its 28th Italian league title.
Juventus remained six points ahead of its southern rival atop the standings with 11 rounds remaining.
Defender Giorgio Chiellini put Juventus ahead with a header 10 minutes in at the San Paolo stadium and Switzerland midfielder Gokhan Inler equalized for Napoli in the 43rd.
Napoli had a great chance to win but Blerim Dzemaili missed a rebound from Marek Hamsik's shot in the 73rd with goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon left out of position. Fans had already gotten up to celebrate but Dzemaili's shot sailed wide.
Before kickoff, a window of the Juventus team bus was broken by Napoli supporters.
