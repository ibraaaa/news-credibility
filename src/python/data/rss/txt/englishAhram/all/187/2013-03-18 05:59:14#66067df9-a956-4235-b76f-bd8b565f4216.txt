England’s Hodgson ‘disappointed’ over Ferdinand's withdrawal
Ferdinand pulls out of England World Cup qualifying squad
Rio Ferdinand has been forced to withdraw from England's upcoming World Cup qualifiers against San Marino and Montenegro, the English FA said on Monday.
In a statement on its website, the FA said the decision was taken following a meeting with England manager Roy Hodgson.
Hodgson was quoted as saying: "I'm disappointed Rio will not be available, but due to the detailed pre-planned training and medical programme he must follow it's not possible."
Steven Caulker of Tottenham Hotspur was called up from the Under-21 squad to replace Ferdinand.
