City wins at Villa to keep flickering hopes alive
Tevez gives Manchester City slight hope of defending their Premier League title
Carlos Tevez kept alive Manchester City's slight hope of successfully defending its Premier League title, scoring in first-half stoppage time Monday night for a 1-0 win at relegation-threatened Aston Villa.
Substitute Edin Dzeko dispossessed Ciaran Clark, dribbled toward the penalty area and passed to Tevez. The forward evaded American goalkeeper Brad Guzan and defender Nathan Baker before slotting the ball into the net.
Referee Mike Dean ignored Clark's complaint he was fouled bu Dzeko.
City (17-3-8) is 12 points behind Manchester United (23-3-2) with 12 games remaining.
Villa (5-14-9) is 18th with 24 points, trailing Wigan on goal difference and one point ahead of Reading and three in front of last-place Queens Park Rangers. The bottom three teams get relegated to the second tier next season.
