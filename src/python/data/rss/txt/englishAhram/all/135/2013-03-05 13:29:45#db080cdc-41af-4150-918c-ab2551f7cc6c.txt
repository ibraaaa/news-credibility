Senegal and former Fulham midfielder Tavares on trial with Ahly
Tavares could boost Ahly midfield immediately, since he is currently without a club after departing England's Fulham
Senegal and Fulham midfielder Mickael Zidro Tavares is currently on trial with Egypt's Ahly, the Cairo giants announced on Tuesday.
According to Ahly's official website, 30-year-old Tavares will be monitored by head coach Hossam El-Badry to determine if he is technically and physically fit to join the club.
The French-born player, Tavares, is currently a free agent after departing the English Premier League club Fulham.
The former Hamburger and Middlesbrough player, who plays as a defensive midfielder, had received his first cap with the Senegalese national football team in 2009.
The 2013 African Super Cup heroes, Ahly, are currently seeking a boost for their midfield, especially after key players Mohamed Nagy Gedo, Ahmed Fathi and Mohamed Mohamed Abou-Treika are on loan this winter.
Barakat is ready for ENPPI
The Red Devils are currently preparing for Sunday's clash against ENPPI and midfielder Mohamed Barakat will be available for the match after recovering from back pain.
"Scans revealed that Barakat is not suffering a serious injury. The player appeared in Tuesday's training session without any problems and is ready for the ENPPI clash," the club revealed.
Ahly, who are third in the Egyptian League table, will have a tough mission to pass second-placed ENNPI in the Egyptian League group (A), before launching their campaign in the CAF Champions League against Kenyan side Tusker one week later.
