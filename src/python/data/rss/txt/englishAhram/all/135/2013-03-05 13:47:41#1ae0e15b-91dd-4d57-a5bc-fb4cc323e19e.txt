Mansoura police officers call for dismissal of Egypt's interior minister
Police officers in the Nile Delta city of Mansoura are to stage a protest Tuesday to demand dismissal of interior minister
A number of Central Security Forces (CSF) officers and soldiers in Daqahliya governorate, located northeast of Cairo, are planning to stage a protest Tuesday to demand the dismissal of interior minister Mohamed Ibrahim.
The police officers are enraged over the detention of a fellow officer accused of killing protester Hossam Abdel-Azim by running him over in a CSF vehicle last Saturday during clashes in Daqahliya's Mansoura city. They argue the minister is to blame for the failing relationship between the people and the police, as well as the ongoing violent clashes and deaths on both sides.
Mansoura has been rocked by intermittent clashes for over a week amid renewed calls for civil disobedience and intensifying protests against President Mohamed Morsi.
