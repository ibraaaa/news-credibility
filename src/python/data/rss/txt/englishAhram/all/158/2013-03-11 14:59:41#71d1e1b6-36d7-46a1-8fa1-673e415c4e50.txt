CAF extend Hayatou’s era
Cameroonian Hayatou re-elected unopposed as CAF president
Issa Hayatou has been re-elected unopposed as president of the African soccer confederation for a final four-year term.
The 66-year-old Hayatou was the only candidate and was retained unanimously at a vote in Marrakech on Sunday. FIFA President Sepp Blatter then presented the Cameroonian with a special certificate to commemorate his 25 years at the helm of CAF.
Earlier this month, FIFA executive committee member Jacques Anouma was barred from being a candidate to lead African soccer, losing his legal challenge to stand for election against Hayatou.
The Court of Arbitration for Sport dismissed Anouma's appeal against CAF, which refused to accept his election bid after he was made ineligible by rule changes engineered by Hayatou.
Hayatou challenged Blatter for the FIFA leadership in 2002 and lost.
