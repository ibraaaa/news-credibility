Rights group: UAE must investigate torture claims
Human Rights Watch says the trial of 94 defendants raises serious questions about UAE's willingness to respect the fundamental right of all accused
A human rights group is calling on the United Arab Emirates to investigate allegations of torture that are being made by defendants on trial for allegedly trying to overthrow the government.
Several of the 94 defendants told a security court last week that they had been repeatedly beaten, kept in solitary confinement, denied medical treatment, blindfolded and forced to take unknown medications.
Human Rights Watch on Monday said the trial "raises serious questions about UAE's willingness to respect the fundamental right of all accused." The group called on the court not to introduce evidence "obtained through ill-treatment or coercion."
The trial resumed Monday but authorities barred international media, including The Associated Press, from attending.
