Syrian gov't reportedly using local groups for mass killings: UN
The UN says the Al-Assad regime is using local militias to commit mass killings
The Syrian government is reportedly using local militias known as Popular Committees to commit mass killings which are at times sectarian in nature, U.N. human rights investigators said on Monday.
"In a disturbing and dangerous trend, mass killings allegedly perpetrated by Popular Committees have at times taken on sectarian overtones," the U.N. commission of inquiry on Syria, led by Brazilian Paulo Pinheiro, said in its latest report to the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva. Investigators cited accounts from witnesses and victims.
