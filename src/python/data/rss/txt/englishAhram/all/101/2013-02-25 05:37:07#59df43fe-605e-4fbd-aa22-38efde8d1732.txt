Egypt's youth team ask for friendlies with DR Congo
The Egyptian U-20 national team coach asks to play two friendlies against DR Congo in preparation for the African Youth Championship
"We need to play more friendlies to prepare well for the African Youth Championship," the tactician was quoted as saying by the Al-Ahram daily newspaper on Monday.
"Friendlies against DR Congo will be useful for the team as they will compete in the African tournament," he added.
Under the helm of the 52-year-old tactician, the Egyptian youth national team played two friendlies against Nigeria, losing the first 3-1 and drawing 0-0 in the second, as part of preparations for the African Youth Championship.
"We discovered the weaknesses in the players' performance during the Nigeria friendlies and we will work to avoid them in the future," Yassin said.
"I ask the Egyptian teams' coaches to help the international players early to establish the harmony between them," the tactician concluded.
The Egypt U-20 team has been drawn in Group A of the African Championship alongside hosts Algeria, Ghana (world champions in 2009) and Benin.
The draw also saw Nigeria, Mali, DR Congo and Gabon drawn together in Group B.
The semifinalists of this competition will represent the continent in the FIFA U-20 World Cup.  
Egypt placed third in the last African Youth Championship.
