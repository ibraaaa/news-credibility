Brother, sons of prominent Egyptian Salafist arrested for Shubra clashes
Following his own arrest, Salafist activist Gamal Saber's sons and brother were arrested on suspicion of involvement in deadly clashes in Shubra
The two sons and brother of a prominent Salafist have been arrested on charges of involvement in deadly clashes in Cairo's Shubra district, announces a security source on Friday.
Gamal Saber is the coordinator of Lazem Hazem (It Must be Hazem), a group supporting former Salafist presidential candidate Hazem Salah Abu-Ismail.
A security source details that Saber’s two sons, Ahmed and Abdel Rahman, were hiding in a relative's home in Rod El Farag district of Cairo. Their uncle, Mohamed Saber, was arrested in the Warraq district.
Saber himself was detained Wednesday for involvement in the same clashes, which left three dead and 27 injured.
The source says the two sons and uncle were escorted to a security headquarter for questioning, but would not reveal the headquarter's location out of fear that their supporters may try to help them escape.
According to the source more than 11 suspects have been detained so far for involvement in the incident.
The source discloses that 10 security teams have been deployed in Cairo, Giza and Qalyubia governorates to detain 19 more suspects within the next few hours.
The clashes broke out on Monday after Saad Dorra (15) was killed during a football match at a school in Shubra, reportedly by Saber's son.
