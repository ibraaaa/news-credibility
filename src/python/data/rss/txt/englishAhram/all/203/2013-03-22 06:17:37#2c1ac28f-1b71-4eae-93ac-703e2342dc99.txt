Gedo to remain at Hull City, Fathi set for Ahly return
Ahly's coach says he intends to recall Ahmed Fathi when his loan stint ends at Hull City but Gedo will remain at the English second-division side
Mohamed Nagy 'Gedo' is set to remain with Hull City beyond the end of the season but right-back Ahmed Fathi, who has been warming the bench since joining the English second-division side, should return to Ahly, coach Hossam El-Badry said on Friday.
"Gedo performs well with Hull City and he can make a history for himself in English football," El-Badry told reporters after Friday's training session.
"I will allow Gedo to join Hull City on a permanent contract after his loan deal expires."
The 28-year-old, best known for scoring five goals to steer Egypt to the last of their record seven African Nations Cup titles in 2010, made an instant impact at Hull after joining on a six-month loan deal in January, scoring five goals in seven appearances.
Right-back Fathi, an indispensible member of Ahly's squad, also joined Hull on loan but could only make one cameo appearance.
"Fathi will be a valuable addition to our squad when he returns from his loan spell at the end of the season. The right side misses him," El-Badry commented.
Veteran playmaker Mohamed Abou-Treika, who joined Emirati club Bani Yas on another short-term loan deal, is also set to return to the club where he made his name at the end of the season.
"I it's difficult to offload Abou-Treika permanently as he is one of the team's key players," El-Badry added.
"I agreed to loan Abou-Treika to Bani Yas after he asked for this move but it's difficult to allow him leave the club again."
