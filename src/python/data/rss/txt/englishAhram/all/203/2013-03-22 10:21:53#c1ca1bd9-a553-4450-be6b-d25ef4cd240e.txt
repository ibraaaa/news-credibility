Egypt finish the group stage with maximum nine points after securing a 1-0 victory over Benin in the U-20 African Championship on Friday
Egypt's U-20 side, who had already ensured to their progress to the African Championship semis and the World Cup, maintained their 100 percent record in the group stage with a 1-0 win over Benin on Friday.
The young Pharaohs finished on top of Group A with nine points, thanks to a goal from midfielder Mahmoud Abdel-Moneim "Kahraba" midway through the first half.
Kahraba scored the winner in the 22nd minute with a simple tap-in on the rebound after a shot was parried by Benin keeper into his path.
Egypt had also beaten Ghana 2-1 and hosts Algeria 1-0 to book their place at the World Cup, which will take place in Turkey in the summer, for the third consecutive time.
Algeria surprisingly failed to reach the semi-final after a 2-0 defeat by Ghana gave the Black Stars the second Group A ticket to the last four.
Egypt will face the runners-up of Group B. Mali top the group with six points, three ahead of Nigeria and five ahead of DR Congo and Gabon with one game remaining.
