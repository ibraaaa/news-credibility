Zamalek more eager for African trophy after Gazelle victory
Egypt's Zamalek are enthusiastic for African Champions League trophy after their 'team-work performance' and 'good coordination' during Gazelle 7-0 win
Zamalek are satisfied after they were able to rout Chad’s Gazelle 7-0 in Alexandria on Sunday to virtually seal their place in the African Champions League round of 32.
"Zamalek played as a really organised team. I congratulated players after their team-work performance," Brazilian coach Jorvan Vieira said in the post-match press conference.
The Cairo giants thanked the security authorities for the fans attendance, hailing the Ultras White Knights enthusiastic return to the stands after a year of absence. A crowd ban had been in place since last year's Port Said football tragedy, which saw over 70 Ahly fans killed in a free-for-all after a league game against Masry.
"Zamalek board thanks the Ultras White Knights for their well-organized cheer, and the Interior Ministry and the Egyptian military for allowing fan attendance and maintaining security," reads a statement published on the club’s official website.
Zamalek veteran Ahmed Hassan, for his side, said in the same statement: "The victory is pleasing, but the upcoming steps are more important as all players need to keep focusing in order to clinch the trophy."
The Egypt skipper, who scored against Gazelle, added: "I present this victory to the beloved Zamalek fans."
Zamalek are bidding to win Africa’s elite club competition for the first time since 2002.
