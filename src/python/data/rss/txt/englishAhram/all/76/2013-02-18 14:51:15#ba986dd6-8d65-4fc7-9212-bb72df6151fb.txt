"The game against Paraguay is a welcome affair for us ahead of the World Cup in order to familiarise ourselves with the typical South American style... and players with outstanding technical skills," Germany coach Joachim Loew said.
Germany, who have yet to qualify for the 2014 finals, are top of European Group C on 10 points from four games, with Sweden in second place on seven from three.
