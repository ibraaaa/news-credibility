Discussion: Brotherhood's Paradise, the story of a defector
Al-Zaytoun literary workshop will host discussion on Sameh Fayez's new book on Muslim Brotherhood Monday, 18 February at 7:00pm
Al-Zaytoun literary workshop will host an evening on Monday, 18 February to discuss the newly-released book on the Muslim Brotherhood
by the young author, Sameh Fayez.
The evening will also host writer Helmi Namnam, an expert in Muslim Brotherhood history, Mohammed Ibrahim Taha and critic Howaida Saleh.
Sameh Fayez joined the Brotherhood at the age of 10, when a member of the Islamist group recruited him from a religious circle in a Cairo mosque.
Fayez began to doubt the Brotherhood's intentions, since they refused to answer his repeated questions regarding their goals and because his notions about women, love and children were totally different. Thus, Fayez "defected" from the Brotherhood in 2005, although he did not release his book until 2013.
