President Morsi to announce 'within days' opening of Egypt parliament nominations
Presidential office sources reveal Morsi will soon announce date of parliament nominations' process; judicial sources reveal problems with constitutionality of elections law
Egypt President Mohamed Morsi is to announce nomination procedures for parliamentary elections later this week or early next week, according to a media report published on Monday.
London-based Al-Hayat newspaper reports that sources within the presidential office also specified to them that elections will take place in three stages and an elected parliament's lower chamber is expected to be in place by the start of July. Elections are set for April, 2013.
The unnamed sources lay out that Egypt's High Constitutional Court (HCC) is to issue its review to the Shura Council (parliamentary upper house) on Monday on laws regulating parliamentary elections.
Meanwhile, judicial sources quoted in the same report as saying the HCC have reservations about certain articles of the draft law.
The Shura Council's next steps are to take into consideration the constitutional court's review, discuss and possibly amend the law before presenting it to the president for ratification.
The People's Assembly (parliamentary lower house) was dissolved in 2012 by an HCC court order that rendered the law that elected that chamber unconstitutional.
The Shura Council has assumed full legislative powers on a temporary basis until the new House of Representatives (formerly called the People's Assembly) is elected.
