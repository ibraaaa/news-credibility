Majority party FJP shoots down demand from opposition NSF meeting for new cabinet
Following a private meeting where opposition National Salvation Front leaders demanded a new cabinet, FJP replies it is not feasible in unstable Egypt
In a private meeting held in ElBaradei's home on Saturday, the three leading political figures discussed a list of demands, mainly concerning reshuffling the cabinet.  
"It is difficult to create a new cabinet, from the FJP's point of view, in such political instability, especially when the country is experiencing a turbulent economic situation," the statement reads.
The FJP added that the party is already considering a ministerial reshuffle to take place after parliamentary elections in April, 2013.
Protests against Morsi's government during and following the two-year anniversary of January 25 Revolution, have prompted several meetings between leading figures to attempt to solve the impasse.
The Islamist Salafist Nour Party has been a leading one initiative to push for dialogue with the main opposition group. The FJP clarified that the meeting with the NSF was not connected to the national dialogue initiative spearheaded by the Nour Party.
