Six arrested in late night clashes in Egypt's Mahalla
Clashes between protesters and Egyptian police in Gharbiya late Sunday result in the arrest of six protesters
Six protesters were arrested in the Nile Delta industrial city of Mahalla, Gharbiya governorate after clashes erupted late Sunday between protesters and Egyptian police.
Clashes ensued late Sunday and continued until dawn Monday, as protesters were reported to have thrown Molotov cocktails and rocks at the local police station and set car tires on fire. Shops also closed early as a result of the violence.
Gharbiya Security Director General Hatem Osman reported that they had arrested six protesters responsible for the violence.
"We reject acts of vandalism directed at any governmental institution, especially as our role is to protect our citizens from lawless individuals," asserted Othman in reports to the state media MENA news agency.
Mahalla has experienced ongoing protests since the January 25 Revolution protests.
Most recently, on Friday, one person was killed after being hit by a car during riots to demand justice for slain activist Mohamed El-Gendy, who died of severe injuries after being detained by police following anti-government demonstrations two weeks ago.
Twenty were arrested for their alleged involvement in attacking the governorate's administration building, Osman reported on the day of the protests.
In a separate incident, Sunday also saw large scale protests in the Suez Canal city of Port Said by residents demanding retribution for those responsible for the death of dozens of the city's residents in clashes that took place in January.
