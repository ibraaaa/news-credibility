Zamalek eye comfortable win over Vita Club in Champions League
Zamalek bid to continue their impressive start to the season at the expense of DR Congo’s Vita Club in the African Champions League on Friday
Zamalek will be looking for a comfortable first-leg victory when they host Congolese side Vita Club in the African Champions League round of 32 at Alexandria’s Borg El-Arab Stadium on Friday.
The match was initially due to be played behind closed doors due to security concerns but, under pressure from Zamalek’s hardcore supporters (Ultras White Knights), Egyptian authorities eventually agreed to allow up to 3,000 spectators to attend the game.
 The five-time African champions are eyeing a comprehensive victory to make sure there will not be any surprises when they face Vita Club away from home in a fortnight.
"We are looking for a comfortable win to make our mission in the second leg easier," Zamalek's young star Mohamed Ibrahim told his club's official website on Thursday.
"We are always looking for victories to advance in the competition,” the 21-year-old added.
Ibrahim, who returned to Zamalek's squad in last week's 3-1 win over El-Entag El-Harby in the Egyptian League after serving a two-match ban, is a key player in Jorvan Vieira's squad.
The White Knights will also have lively winger Hazem Emam available after he recovered from an injury that prevented him from playing against El-Entag.
Zamalek made a superb start to the season, winning their first six league games to top Group B with 18 points.
They were equally formidable in the Champions League, opening their campaign with a 7-0 aggregate victory over Chad’s Gazelle in the preliminary round.
Zamalek won the last of their five Champions League trophies in 2002.
