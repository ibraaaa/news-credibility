David Beckham arrives in China as football ambassador
The former England captain named as football ambassador in China to help youngsters after recent corruption scandals in the country
David Beckham has arrived in China as an ambassador to help develop young players as the country tries to clean up its football image after a spate of corruption scandals.
The former England captain says he isn't concerned about the match-fixing scandals in China, with several players and officials sentenced to prison.
Beckham also says he hasn't ruled out playing professionally in China someday.
Beckham is due to play an exhibition game in China in November, five months after his contract with Paris Saint-Germain expires. While considered to be close to retiring, Beckham says he would consider playing on if he felt physically fit and mentally engaged.
