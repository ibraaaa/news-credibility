Team spirit is key to success, Egypt U-20s coach says
Pharaohs U-20s team qualifies for World Cup after gaining spot in African Championship semifinals by defeating Ghana and Algeria
"The reason for our success in Algeria, defeating powerful sides Ghana [2-1] and Algeria in the first round, is the team's united spirit and moral commitment," the coach told Ahram Sports after the match.
The Pharaohs top Group A with maximum six points to ensure their progress to the World Cup, which will take place in Turkey in the summer. The semi-finalists in Groups A and B will qualify for the World Cup.
"I learned from coach Mahmoud El-Gohary [former Egypt manager who inspired the seniors to reach their last World Cup in 1990] and followed in his steps by working on the team's enthusiasm.
"I refuse to keep any players that don't contribute to the team's spirit. I will not mention names now as I just want to enjoy the celebrations."
Sports Minister El-Amry Farouk decided after the victory to support the team in their trip to the Turkey World Cup with LE1 million.
Egyptian Football Association (EFA) Chairman Gamal Allam congratulated the team, saying "their success made us forget the damage that happened to the EFA headquarters."
Bob Bradley, manager of the senior team, praised the team saying "they are the future of Egyptian football."
Egypt were knocked out of the U-20 World Cup at the last-16 stage in 2009 and 2011.
