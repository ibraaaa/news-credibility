Egypt to announce int'l tender for Iraqi crude oil shipping
International shipping companies will have opportunity to deliver Iraqi crude oil imports to Egypt through a global tender in April
Egypt plans on Wednesday to announce an international tender for shipping companies that will be tasked with transporting the country’s oil imports from Iraq in April, Anadolu news agency reports.
An anonymous official from the Egyptian Petroleum Corporation told the Turkish news agency that the winning company would be entitled to deliver four million barrels of Iraqi crude oil to Egypt per month.
The bid will include the technical and financial conditions that should be met by the bidders.
Earlier this month, Egypt reached an agreement with Iraq to build crude oil pipelines between the two countries, passing through Jordan, to start refining oil in Egypt into consumable products such as diesel, gasoline and liquefied petroleum gas.
Egyptian petroleum minister said the new agreement with Iraq would help fill part of the state’s 13 thousand tonne diesel 
shortfall.
Egypt produces roughly 22,000 tonnes of diesel a day while consumption is 35,000 tonnes per day.
