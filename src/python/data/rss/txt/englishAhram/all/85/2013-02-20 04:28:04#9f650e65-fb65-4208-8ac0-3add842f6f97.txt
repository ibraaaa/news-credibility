Egypt's Morsi meets members of Gamaa Islamiya's political arm
President Morsi holds meeting with members of Al-Gamaa Al-Islamiya's Building and Development Party, voices readiness to reconcile with Salafist Nour Party
President Mohamed Morsi on Tuesday met a delegation of the Building and Development Party (BDP), the political wing of Al-Gamaa Al-Islamiya, with whom he reportedly discussed issues pertaining to security, social justice and Egypt's current political and economic situation.
The meeting, held at the presidential palace in Cairo, was attended by leading BDP members, including Tareq El-Zomor, Safwat Abdel-Ghany and Nasr Abdel-Salam.
Presidential aides Pakinam El-Sharkawi and Ayman Ali also attended the meeting.
Meeting attendees reportedly discussed issues related to Egyptian expatriates resident overseas and possible means of resolving the ongoing dispute between the presidency and the Salafist Nour Party over the abrupt dismissal earlier this week of leading Nour Party member Khaled Alam El-Din from his post as presidential advisor.
After the meeting, the BDP's Abdel-Salam told Al-Ahram's Arabic-language news website that President Morsi had "shown willingness" to reconcile with Egypt's leading Salafist party.
On Sunday, Alam El-Din was dismissed from his presidential advisory post, reportedly based on allegations that he had exploited his position for personal gain.
Alam El-Din vehemently denied the charge, while the Nour Party convened a press conference on Monday to demand an official apology from the presidency.
