A group of workers were trying to clean the open sewer when they fell in
Nine people were killed and three have been injured after falling into an open sewer at a sewage plant in Meit Kanaa village in Qalyubia governorate in the Nile Delta, reported Al-Ahram Arabic website.
According to security sources, four workers were cleaning the sewer when they fell into it. The rest fell in while trying to save the others from drowning.
Health officials in Qalyubia said that all the victims died of suffocation.
Angry at the incident, dozens of residents of the village gathered at the family medical centre, where seven of the bodies were transported. They voiced anger at the "negligence of the executive bodies."
Heads of the families eventually intervened to calm the protesters, and stressed the sewer was open because it was undergoing maintenance, describing the incident as "pre-ordained."
