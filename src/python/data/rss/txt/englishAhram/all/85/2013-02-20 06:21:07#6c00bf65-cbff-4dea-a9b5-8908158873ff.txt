Security forces arrest an unemployed Egyptian citizen for attempting to attack the Beni Suef governor Maher Beibars with a blade
An unemployed Egyptian citizen tried to attack the governor of Beni Suef Maher Beibars with a knife in front of the governor's office on Wednesday, according to Egyptian state-run MENA news agency.
Security forces arrested the assailant when he tried to attack Beibars as he checked the food vehicles in front of the governor's office building.
35-year-old Mosaab Shaaban held a knife in his hand and walked towards the governor saying, "I have a poison in my house and my mom died poisoned. My pigeons died poisoned! I want a LE50 million compensation."
The security forces arrested Shaaban after they took the blade tied to his hand.
The report of the incident has been presented to the prosecution that has led to further investigations, said Lieutenant Mohamed Abdel Wahab.
