Anti-Morsi protesters attack governorate HQ in Egypt's Nile Delta
Clashes are re-ignited in restive Nile Delta city of Mansoura after demonstrators stage rally to protest detention of fellow activists
 
Dozens of protesters attacked the Daqahliya governorate headquarters in the Nile Delta city of Mansoura on Wednesday evening to protest the state prosecution's decision to detain for four days those arrested in recent clashes with police.
Part of the governorate caught fire prompting a fire truck to rush to the scene, Al-Ahram's Arabic-language news website reported.
The fire was eventually extinguished and calm restored to the area. Security has also been stepped up and attempts remain ongoing to clear the streets on which protesters had converged.
Clashes between anti-Muslim Brotherhood protesters and security forces in Mansoura intensified on Tuesday evening, leaving dozens injured and arrested.
Hundreds of security personnel cracked down on protesters who had blocked Suez Canal Street near the governorate headquarters.
The clashes followed calls on Sunday for a civil disobedience campaign in Mansoura to protest against President Mohamed Morsi and the Muslim Brotherhood group from which he hails.
Protesters accused Brotherhood members and security forces of attacking them on Monday as they attempted to close down the Daqahliya governorate building.
Port Said, situated on Egypt's Suez Canal, has been subject to a ten-day-long civil disobedience campaign after death sentences were handed down to 21 local residents for their roles in last year's Port Said stadium disaster .
In Mahalla, located in the Gharbiya governorate, hundreds went on strike, blocking the main routes into the city on Sunday as part of the ongoing civil disobedience campaign against President Morsi.
