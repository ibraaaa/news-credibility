Former president Hosni Mubarak, former interior minister Habib El-Adly and six aides to face retrial on 13 April for killing of protesters during revolution
The retrial of former president Hosni Mubarak and his interior minister Habib El-Adly will begin on 13 April.
Mubarak and Adly were handed life sentences in June 2012 for the killing of protesters during the January 25 Revolution.
The Court of Appeal, headed by Judge Samir Abul-Moaty, announced the trial date on Sunday.
A court accepted Mubarak's request for a retrial in January. El-Adly, and six of his aides who were acquitted in the initial trial, will also be retried.
Mubarak and El-Adly are currently being held in jail on other charges of graft and corruption.
