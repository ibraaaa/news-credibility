Ismailia joins civil disobedience campaign
Protesters in Ismailia near the vital Suez Canal block the main road and try to block the railway, announcing they are joining the civil disobedience campaign seen in nearby cities
Several protesters in the Suez Canal city of  Ismailia, announce they are launching a civil disobedience campaign on Sunday, joining nearby Port Said and Mansoura in their campaigns.
Tens of protesters blocked the main road leading to the central governorate building, urging the city's residents to join the civil disobedience campaign.
A protest is planned for Sunday afternoon in front of the governorate building by a number of political groups and movements, calling for Prime Minister Hisham Qandil to be sacked, amendments to the new constitution passed in December 2012, the elimination of the elections law and the realisation of other revolutionary demands.
Protesters attempted to block the railway, halting the train route from Cairo to Port Said, but police forces intervened, reports Al-Ahram Arabic news site.
Port Said has been on a civil disobedience campaign for almost two weeks, with the Nile Delta city of Mansoura joining a week later. Suez, Mahalla and Tanta have also joined.
Most recently, on Saturday, violent clashes ensued between police and protesters, following the death of one man, who was reported to have been run over by a Central Security Forces truck.
