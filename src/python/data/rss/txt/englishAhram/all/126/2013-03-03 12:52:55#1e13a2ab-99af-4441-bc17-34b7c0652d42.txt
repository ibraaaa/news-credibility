Syria rebels kill more than 34 regime forces inside Aleppo's sprawling police academy
Syrian rebels killed more than 34 government forces in an attack Sunday on a police academy in the northern province of Aleppo and seized large parts of the facility, a monitoring group said.
They "seized control at dawn of large parts of the police academy" in Khan al-Assal, after eight days of fierce fighting for one of the regime's last bastions in the west of Aleppo province, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.
"More than 34 regime forces were killed" inside the town's sprawling police academy, it said.
The watchdog, which relies on activists and medics on the ground, said it did not have immediate reports on rebel casualties, but it has previously reported dozens of fighters killed on both sides in the battle for the police academy.
