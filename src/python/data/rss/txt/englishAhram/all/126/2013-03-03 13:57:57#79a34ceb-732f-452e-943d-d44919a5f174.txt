Real Madrid players proud to beat Barcelona again; excited for Man U
Real Madrid players, happy after beating Barcelona for second time within five days, feel encouraged to take on Manchester United in the Champions League
Real Madrid defender Sergio Ramos touts that his side can win the Manchester United clash after beating Barcelona for the second time in a week.
The Whites beat Barcelona for the second time in five days, earning a 2-1 win Saturday, which will do little to prevent its fierce rival from reclaiming the Spanish league title, but should boost Jose Mourinho's team ahead of its critical Champions League trip to Manchester United.
"After the two Clasicos we’re going to Manchester believing that we can win," Ramos was quoted as saying on Real Madrid's official website.
"The Clasicos are always different and we are proud of the job that we did,
"We are pleased because we used different players from the squad, players who have had fewer minutes on the pitch and they have given their all and we got all three points."
Midfielder Pepe also praised his team's performance throughout the win over Barcelona.
"We showed that we are a group and we fight to the end," Pepe said.
"We have got two important consecutive wins, both because of how we played and because of who they came against, which is a great motivation for the match against Manchester United," the midfielder added.
Real Madrid defeated Barcelona 3-1 early on Tuesday in the Spain Cup semifinals in Camp Nou, and they are scheduled to face Manchester United in the second leg of the Champions League 16th round on 5 March.
