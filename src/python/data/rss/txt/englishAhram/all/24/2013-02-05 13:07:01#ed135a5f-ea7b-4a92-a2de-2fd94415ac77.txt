The music is fading away on Cairo's Mohamed Ali street
A street that was once the heart of Arabic music and culture sees its stores closing en masse due to rise of Islamist culture and economic woes
During its heyday, it was famed as the lively and romantic heart of Arabic music — a Cairo street modeled after Paris’ boulevards, home to musicians, belly-dancers and instrument makers.
But Mohammed Ali Street is fading. It had already been in decline for years as a music center. Now the crunch of post-revolution Egypt may finish it off, between economic crisis, uncontrolled urban sprawl and the rising influence of Muslim conservatives, its patrons fear.
