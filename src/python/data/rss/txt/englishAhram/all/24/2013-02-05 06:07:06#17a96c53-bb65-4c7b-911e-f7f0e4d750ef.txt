Egypt's net foreign reserves fell by $1.4 billion in January to $13.613 billion, the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) stated on Tuesday.
As of the end of December, net reserves had stood at $15.014 billion, down $21 million on the previous month.
In January, the CBE, for the first time, announced how foreign currency injections made in 2011 and 2012 had been allocated.
In a report, the bank noted that it had made $36 billion available for four major spending items – including petroleum and wheat purchases – during the two years in question.
In 2011 alone, according to the report, the bank provided a total of $21 billion, some half of which was intended to cover capital flight.
