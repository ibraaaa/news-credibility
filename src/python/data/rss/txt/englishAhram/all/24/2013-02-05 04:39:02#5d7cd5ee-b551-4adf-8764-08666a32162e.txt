Zamalek key midfielders Hassan and Awad to miss Shorta tie
Hassan and Awad will not be available for Zamalek's second match in the Egyptian Premier League season on Saturday
Zamalek midfielders Ahmed Hassan and Islam Awad will not be available for Saturday's clash against Ittihad El-Shorta due to injury, the Cairo giants announced on Tuesday.
The Whites had a good start for the Egyptian Premier League season after winning their first match against Ittihad of Alexandria 2-0 on Sunday. They will take on Ittihad El-Shorta in the second round of the domestic tournament but without the midfield duo.
"Hassan and Awad will not be available for the Ittihad El-Shorta clash as they haven't recovered from their injuries," Zamalek's chief of medical staff Mostafa El-Monayeri was quoted as saying by the club's official website.
Hassan missed Zamalek's league opener against Ittihad of Alexandria due to calf injury, while Awad was not available because of a thigh injury.
Zamalek, who have not lifted the domestic trophy since 2004, are already missing the services of Salah Soliman and Ahmed Samir due to minor injuries.
The league kicked-off on Saturday after a one-year suspension following the Port Said Stadium disaster that left over 70 Ahly fans dead after a match with rivals Masry.
