Egypt striker Ahmed Hassan 'Koka' to skip African youth Championship
Egypt's Portugal-based striker decides to give upcoming U-20 African Championship a miss, despite having been selected for team's squad
The 19-year-old, who scored four goals in ten matches with Rio Ave this season, was earlier selected by coach Rabie Yassine for Egypt's squad in the African Championship, which will take place in Algeria from 16 to 30 March.
Yassine expressed his displeasure with Hassan's decision, adding that he would not let the player skip the tournament "too easily," declining to elaborate further.
