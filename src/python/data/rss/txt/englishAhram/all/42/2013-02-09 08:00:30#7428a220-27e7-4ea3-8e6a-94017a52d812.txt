Tunisia PM to resign if new cabinet bid fails
Prime Minister Hamadi Jebali told Tunisian media on Saturday he will step down if he fails in his effort to form a new government within days, after his Islamist party rejected the plan.
"I will present the team no later than the middle of next week," Jebali said.
"If it is accepted... I will continue to carry out my duties as head of the government. Otherwise, I will ask the president of the republic to find another candidate to form a new government."
