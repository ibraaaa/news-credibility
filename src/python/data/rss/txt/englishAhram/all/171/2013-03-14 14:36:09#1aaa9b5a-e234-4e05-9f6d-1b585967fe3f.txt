Egypt suffer worst-ever FIFA ranking for second consecutive month
Lack of competitive action sees Pharaohs drop 21 positions in two months to 75 in FIFA global football ranking
Egypt have dropped to 75 in FIFA's world football ranking for March, their worst position since the list was established in 1993.
The Pharaohs' previous worst position was in February 2013.
The winners of seven African Nations Cup (CAN) trophies, who featured in the global top ten in 2010, fell another five places in March after falling 16 places in February.
Egypt's ranking has been affected by a lack of competitive action after failing to qualify for the 2012 and 2013 African Cup of Nations, and the Port Said disaster – during which 72 Ahly fans died at a match with Masry – that lead to the postponement of the domestic league for over one year.
Under former United States manager Bob Bradley, the Pharaohs are bidding for a spot at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil and host Zimbabwe on 26 March.
They top Group G in the qualifiers with six points from two games, three ahead of second-placed Guinea. Zimbabwe and Mozambique hold one point each.
Bradley has vowed to secure Egypt their first ticket to the most prestigious global competition since 1990, despite losing in friendly games 0-3 to Ghana, 2-4 to Ivory Coast, 1-2 to Chile and 1-3 to Qatar.
The world's top five remain Spain, Germany, Argentina, England and Italy.
Ivory Coast are still the top African team in front of Ghana, Mali and Nigeria, while Algeria are the top Arab country ahead of Tunisia, Libya and Egypt.
