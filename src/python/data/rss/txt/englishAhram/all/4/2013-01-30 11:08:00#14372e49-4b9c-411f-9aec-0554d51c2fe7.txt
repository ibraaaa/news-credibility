Electricity returns to Upper Egypt after short power outage
Assiut Governor blames power cut on 'technical failures' in Egypt's electricity grid
Electricity has returned to eight governorates in the south of the country after a stoppage that lasted for 7 to 40 minutes.
The Upper Egyptian governorate of Assiut and seven other southern governorates suffered a power outage on Wednesday night reportedly due to a technical failure, Al-Ahram's Arabic-language news website has reported.
According to Assiut's Governorate Secretary-General Gamal Adam, the outage was caused by failures in the national electricity network, which extends from the southern city of Aswan to Giza in the north.
The technical problem has since been resolved, Adam added, stressing that electricity would be gradually restored to the impacted areas.
Last summer, Egypt was plagued by lengthy electricity outages on an almost daily basis due to a lack of fuel.
