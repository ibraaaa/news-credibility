Al-Wasl offload Egypt's forward Shikabala
Mahmoud Abdel-Razek 'Shikabala' adventure at Al-Wasl ended on Wednesday as the UAE club signed Brazilian forward Jose Vieira to replace him
UAE side Al-Wasl announced on Wednesday the signature of Brazilian forward Jose Vieira to replace Egyptian counterpart Mahmoud Abdel-Razek 'Shikabala'.
"We signed Vieira to replace Shikabala," said the club on their twitter account on Wednesday.
The 27-year-old has not played with Al-Wasl since his injury on 16th December.
Shikabala's fate is not determined yet as the player's contract expires at the end of this season.
The international forward has signed a one-year loan deal with the UAE side last summer following to his fallout with his home-team Zamalek's former coach Hassan Shehata.
Shikabal produced a string of strong performances with the club, scoring five goals (four in the UAE league and one in the UAE Cup) and he was instrumental in the team's line-up with Bruno Metsu and Guy Lacombem. However, the club's desire to fortify their squad, who are struggling in the UAE league, pushed management to sign the Brazilian forward.
