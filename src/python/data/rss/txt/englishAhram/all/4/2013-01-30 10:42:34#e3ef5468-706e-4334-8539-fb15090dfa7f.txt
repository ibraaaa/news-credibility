Kamara to join Norwich on loan from Sporting KC
Forward Kei Kamara has been loaned from Major League Soccer's Sporting Kansas City to Norwich of England's Premier League through May 6
Kamara, who is from Sierra Leone, has received international clearance but requires a British work permit.
Norwich manager Chris Hughton says ''there is no doubt it is a big jump to make into the Premier League, but it is an exciting challenge both for him and us here at the club to prove his talent.''
Sporting KC said Kamara's contract has been extended and Norwich has an option to keep Kamara on a full transfer.
