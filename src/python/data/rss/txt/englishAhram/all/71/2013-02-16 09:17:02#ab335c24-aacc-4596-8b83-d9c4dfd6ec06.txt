Detained Egyptian activist starts hunger strike protesting maltreatment
Alexandria activist Hassan Mostafa has gone on hunger strike in detention, complaining of maltreatment, refuting accusations
Detained Egyptian activist Hassan Mostafa started a hunger strike Saturday complaining of maltreatment inside his Borg El-Arab prison, announced his lawyer Hamdy Khalaf, according to Al-Ahram Arabic website.
Mostafa is currently detained pending investigations on accusations of assaulting the judiciary. He is accused of attacking the prosecutor of Mansheya Criminal Court in Alexandria.
Mostafa has denied all accusations, saying he was filing a complaint against the detention of fellow activists when he was arrested and falsely accused.
Hundreds of activists are currently detained, according to rights lawyers, many of which arrested during recent demonstrations against President Mohamed Morsi. Others have reportedly been arrested while protesting the detention of friends.
Many activists have complained of maltreatment following their arrest and several have alleged they faced torture during detention. One activist, Mohamed El-Gendy, died of injuries allegedly sustained under police torture while in detention.  
Opposition protests have been frequent over recent months, mostly in Cairo and Alexandria. Several anti-government demonstrations have turned violent as clashes erupted between protesters and police.
