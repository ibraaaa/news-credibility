Egypt’s Gedo scores again as Hull edge past Charlton
Mohamed Nagy ‘Gedo’ finds the net for the second consecutive game, Ahmed Fathi makes his debut as Hull City beat Charlton Athletic 1-0
Egypt forward Mohamed Nagy ‘Gedo’ scored his second goal in as many appearances to lead Hull City to a narrow 1-0 win over Charlton Athletic in the English Championship (second division) on Saturday.
The Ahly-bound man, who moved to Hull from the Egyptian giants on loan until the end of the season, netted a first-half winner to continue his superb start, having also scored in the Tigers’ 2-1 win over Derby County last Tuesday.
Fellow countryman Ahmed Fathi, who also joined from Ahly, made his maiden Hull appearance after replacing Paul McShane in the 56th minute.
Gedo put Hull in front after 33 minutes when he bundled the ball home from close range after Charlton goalkeeper Ben Hamer missed a corner.
He could have scored his second of the night one minute past the hour mark when he was set up by a pinpoint cross from compatriot Ahmed Elmohamady but his header missed the target.
The 28-year-old, who was substituted in stoppage time, was named man of the match.
Hull lie second in the Championship table with 56 points from 31 games.
