Egypt's jobless rate rose 0.5% in Q4/2012
Tardy economic activity has led to a rise in unemployment in Egypt by four percent since 2010
Egypt’s unemployment rate saw a slight rise of 0.5 percent quarter on quarter in Q4 of 2012, reaching 13 percent of the country’s total labour force, state statistical body CAPMAS reported Saturday.
The total number of working Egyptians is currently 23.5 million, according to CAPMAS.
Compared to the fourth quarter of 2010, the jobless rate has risen by four percent. CAPMAS puts rising unemployment down to the slow economic activity, especially after the January 2011 uprising.
The quarterly report added that 9.6 percent of the total unemployed are males, while the proportion becomes higher among jobless females to reach 24.7 percent.
Unemployment in urban areas has reached 17 percent and just less than 10 percent in rural areas.
