Zamalek coach promises new faces with future chances
Zamalek's Portuguese coach is satisfied with Tuesday's win over Talae El-Gaish, although disappointed at missed chances at goal
Zamalek coach Jorvan Vieira has vowed to rotate his starting line-up in the coming matches, as the team builds on a successful start to the Egyptian league season.
The Whites secured their seventh consecutive league win after beating Talae El-Gaish 2-1 on Tuesday.
After making their best league start since 2003, the Cairo giants are currently on top of their group in the competition's new format with a maximum 21 points from seven games.
"El-Gaish was not an easy opponent, especially as they depend on attacking football. We were lucky to score early but we missed a lot of chances against the goal," Vieira said in the press conference after the match.
"The pitch was so bad and that cost us much effort, but finally we got the match's three points," he added.
Young stars Hazem Emam, Ahmed Tawfik and Ahmed El-Shenawy had a prominent role in Zamalek's success against El-Gaish and the Portuguese coach promised to continue pushing new faces.
"I can't depend on 11 players only in all matches, so all players will have the chance to appear in the coming period," explained Vieira.
"The national team recently called up 10 Zamalek players for the anticipated World Cup qualifier against Zimbabwe, which means that we are on the right track," he concluded.
Zamalek is also flourishing on the continental level, drawing one step closer to the African Champions League round of 16 after claiming a narrow 1-0 victory over DR Congo's Vita Club on Friday.
