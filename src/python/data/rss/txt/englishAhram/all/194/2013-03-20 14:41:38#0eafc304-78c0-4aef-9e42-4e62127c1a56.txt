Ivory Coast's Toure considers Manchester City exit
Ivory Coast midfielder does not feel sufficient 'respect' at Manchester City
Ivory Coast midfielder Yaya Toure could announce his departure from Manchester City if he doesn't get a contract renewal by next Saturday.
The 29-year-old, whose current contract with the Citizens runs until 2015, is in talks with the management over renewal for six months but it seems that he is currently bored.
"If he signs a contract in the next three or four days, okay. If not, we will not wait any longer and will start negotiations with different clubs," Toure's representative Dmitri Seluk told British daily The Sun.
"Today is Tuesday, so it means by Saturday. We will say 'Thank you. OK, Yaya will leave in May.'
"I do not feel he will stay at City. This is not about money. He wants to leave because of many reasons.
"He is one of the best players at Manchester City but does not feel the respect of the staff. Only Roberto Mancini respects Yaya," he added.
Toure, who joined Premier League giants from Barcelona in 2010, is currently on international duty with his national team as it prepares for a 2014 World Cup qualifier against Gambia.
If City's owner Sheikh Mansour made a call to the Ivorian star, the matter could totally change, according to the player's representative.
"It's all strange. It's not normal to have negotiations for six months about a contract," Seluk said.
