Blasts at bus park in north Nigeria's Kano kill 25
At least 25 people were killed following five explosions in Nigeria
Five explosions at a bus park in northern Nigeria's main city of Kano killed at least 25 people on Monday in an area where Islamist sect Boko Haram is waging an insurgency against the government, a Reuters reporter who counted the bodies said.
The blasts destroyed several buses in the Sabon Gari area of Kano, an area mostly inhabited by immigrants from Nigeria's largely Christian south, the Reuters witness said. Military and police cordoned off the area after the blasts.
