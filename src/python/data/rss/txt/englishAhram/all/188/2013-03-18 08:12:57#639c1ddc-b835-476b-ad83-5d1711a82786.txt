Preview: Egypt U-20 hopes for win against Algeria to reach World Cup
Egyptian U-20 team must vanquish Algeria in Tuesday's Africa Youth Championship clash to earn early qualification for FIFA U-20 World Cup
 
Egypt's U-20 team are hoping to maintain their promising start in the ongoing Africa Youth Championship when they face hosts Algeria in day two of the continental tournament.
Egypt, who defeated Ghana 2-1 in the group opener, currently lead Group A with three points – two points ahead of second placed Algeria.    
A win against Algeria would help Egypt reach the tournament's semi-finals and go through to the FIFA U-20 World Cup set to take place in Turkey this summer.
"We're looking for a win against Algeria on Tuesday," Egypt U-20 assistant coach Mohamed Saad said at a Monday news conference. "This would secure our team a place in the semi-finals and reach the FIFA U-20 World Cup, which is our main target."
The four semi-finalists will qualify for the FIFA U-20 World Cup set, to be played this summer in Algeria.  
Meanwhile, Algeria's French coach, Jan Marc Nobilo, said on Monday that he was looking for a positive result against Egypt "in order to satisfy the team's fans."
He added that his team's qualification for the next round would be decided by the third match against Ghana, not against Egypt.
"We're looking for a positive result against Egypt because Algerian fans won't accept a loss,'' Nobilo said.
Algeria were held to a goalless draw by Benin in the tournament's opener on Saturday.
