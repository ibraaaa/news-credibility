Police extend detention of 15 anti-Brotherhood protesters for 4 days
Prosecutors also ordered the arrest of three men accused of attacking journalists outside the Muslim Brotherhood headquarters on Saturday
South Cairo prosecutor Tarek Abu Ziad ordered the detention for four extra days of 15 protesters arrested during clashes on Sunday night at the Muslim Brotherhood headquarters in Mokattam, pending investigations.
The 15 detainees were arrested during clashes between angry protesters and Central Security Forces, who were securing the headquarters, located in a south-eastern Cairo suburb. They are facing charges of assaulting security forces, illegal assembly and destroying police cars.
Activists claimed online that detainees were interrogated at Helwan Police Station early in the morning without lawyers.
The South Cairo prosecution office is also continuing its investigations and interrogation of another 31 people who were arrested during the clashes Sunday night.
The prosecutor-general has also ordered the arrest of three men accused of attacking journalists on Saturday at the Brotherhood office.
On Saturday, clashes broke out initially between members of the Brotherhood and a group of graffiti artists and protesters who were painting anti-Brotherhood slogans in the area. Journalists present also reported being attacked by Brotherhood members.
Later on Saturday night, further clashes took place between protesters and the Central Security Forces. 
On Sunday night protesters who rallied to demonstrate against Saturday's violence and arrests clashed with security forces at the headquarters.
