Preview: Egypt's Zamalek eye league win against Talae El-Gaish
Cairo giants hope to secure seventh consecutive Egyptian Premier League win on Tuesday when they face off with Talae El-Gaish
The Whites have delivered outstanding performances since the launch of the season, bagging the maximum 18 points from six games to top Group B.
Zamalek is also flourishing on the continental level, drawing one step closer to the African Champions League round of 16 after claiming a narrow 1-0 victory over DR Congo's Vita Club on Friday.
The Cairo giants' technical staff hopes to overcome mistakes by the players in Tuesday's match ahead of their upcoming trip to DR Congo, where they will play the second leg of round 32 on 7 April.
"We have decided to forget the African tournament and concentrate only on the domestic league until the second leg next month," Zamalek assistant coach Osama Nabih said after Friday's match.
"The technical staff will focus on avoiding the mistakes that we made in the first leg, so as to successfully complete our African campaign," the coach added.
Talae El-Gaish, currently in sixth place of Group B with 8 points, will be seeking their third win this season by halting the Whites' formidable advance.  
"The clash with El-Gaish will not be easy, especially as they are delivering outstanding performances this season," said Nabih.
"Winning the match is a must in order for us to maintain leadership of the group," he concluded.
Experienced goalkeeper Abdel-Wahed El-Sayed will not be available for Zamalek, as he was called up for Egypt's roster for the Zimbabwe clash.
Talented player Ahmed El-Shenawy, for his part, who has just recovered from a serious knee injury, will be available between the sticks.
Zamalek are currently making a bid for the Egyptian League title for the first time since 2004.
