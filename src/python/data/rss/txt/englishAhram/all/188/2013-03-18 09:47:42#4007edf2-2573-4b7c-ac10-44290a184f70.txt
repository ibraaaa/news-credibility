Al-Jazeera plans British, French news channels
Al-Jazeera's TV network directors reveals preparations for launching new branches in Britain and France
Qatar's Al-Jazeera television network said Monday it was preparing to launch a news channel in Britain while studies are at an advanced stage for a French-language channel.
"We are currently working to launch a news channel from the United Kingdom," said the network's Director General Sheikh Ahmed bin Jassim Al-Thani in Doha, adding it will be called Al-Jazeera UK.
The British channel will broadcast for five hours during prime time as a cut-in UK content aired on Al-Jazeera English channel, which was opened in 2006, an Al-Jazeera official told AFP.
Al-Thani also said that studies were at an "advanced stage" to launch a French-language channel aimed at "building bridges with other cultures and peoples."
The network which opened Al-Jazeera Balkan in Sarajevo in 2011 is readying to open Al-Jazeera Turkish, Al-Thani said.
In January, American television channel Current TV, co-founded by former US president Al Gore in 2005, said it was acquired by Al-Jazeera, providing the Qatar-owned network with a wide distribution platform in the United States.
Al-Thani said on Monday that Al-Jazeera has got "the right to broadcast nationwide in the United States."
Al-Jazeera has revolutionised the Arabic-language media and reporting on the Middle East since its foundation in 1996. Its coverage has many times caused disruption to the channel's operations in a number of Arab countries.
During the so-called Arab Spring uprising, the channel has faced repeated accusations of being biased.
