One dead and three injured in Alexandria building collapse
In the Egyptian coastal city of Alexandria a building with an unfulfilled demolition order collapses, killing one and injuring at least five
The three-storey residential building in the district of Muharram Bek in Alexandria was affected by construction taking place in a building adjacent to it, reports the official state news agency MENA.
An investigation reveals the building had a demolition order, but it was not carried out. The construction on the new adjacent building further sped its collapse. A search is on for anyone who may be trapped.
Buildings collapsing in the city of Alexandria has become common, owing to several factors, including buildings' old age, illegal extensions on buildings and corruption between officials and landlords in regulating the housing sector in heavily-populated areas.
Most recently, on January 16, a building collapsed in Al-Maamoura district killing 28 and injuring at least eleven more.     
In 2008, at least 11 people were killed in Alexandria after a four-storey building collapsed at night while residents were asleep.
A similar collapse in July 2012 killed at least nine people, and in October that year, another four were killed.
