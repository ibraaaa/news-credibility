Juventus coach Conte questioned on match-fixing again
Italian soccer federation prosecutor questions Juventus coach Antonio Conte over match-fixing allegations
Juventus coach Antonio Conte has been questioned again by the Italian soccer federation's prosecutor about a match-fixing case.
Having already been suspended for four months at the start of this season for failing to report fixing when he coached Siena two years ago, Conte faces a possible similar charge stemming from when he managed Bari in 2008-09.
Court officials have been investigating Bari's matches with Treviso in May 2008 and Salernitana in May 2009. With little to gain, Bari lost both games, having already secured a mid-standings finish in 2008 and the Serie B title in 2009.
Conte, on course to guide Juventus to a second consecutive Serie A title, was accompanied by three lawyers for the meeting with prosecutor Stefano Palazzi.
Conte denies wrongdoing.
Upon exiting the three-hour hearing, Conte said he ''absolutely'' is not worried about facing more punishment.
