Basel coach praises Egypt's El-Neny
Murat Yakin praises performance of new signing, Egyptian midfielder Mohamed El-Neny, in friendly on Saturday
Basel coach Murat Yakin has praised the performance of Mohamed El-Neny during their 2-0 loss to FC Biel in a friendly on Saturday.
Egyptian midfielder Mohamed El-Neny recently signed for the Swiss club.
"We lost the friendly, but on the positive side our Egyptian midfielder Mohamed El-Neny performed well," Yakin said after the game.
The 22-year-old midfielder has been included in the Egypt squad to face Chile in a friendly on Wednesday.
"We will face a problem when seven players go away on international duty," Yakin said.
Former Arab Contractors star El-Neny became the second Egyptian player to sign for Basel, joining compatriot Mohamed Salah on a six-month loan deal.
According to the club's official website, Basel have an option to sign El-Nenny permanently after the end of the season.
El-Neny, who shone during the Olympic Games in London last year, has become a regular member of Egypt's senior team.
