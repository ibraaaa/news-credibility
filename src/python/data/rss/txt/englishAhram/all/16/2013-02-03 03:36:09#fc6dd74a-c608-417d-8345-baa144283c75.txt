Following outrage over beating and dragging of naked man outside presidential palace on Friday, prosecution opens investigation into police officer and 15 Central Security Forces conscripts
A police officer and 15 Central Security Forces conscripts are under investigation for the beating and dragging of a naked man during an anti-Morsi protest on Friday, the prosecution has announced.
Security forces were filmed beating and dragging a naked man, Hamada Saber, along the floor outside the presidential palace. The footage, aired by Al-Hayat satellite channel, has provoked an outcry across Egypt.
The 50-year-old is currently being treated for his injuries in hospital.
Saber has claimed he was not taking part in the protest and was responsible for what happened to him because he got in the way of the security forces.
A court in Heliopolis has begun a separate investigation into alleged violent attacks by police against protesters outside the presidential palace on Friday. One protester and 40 protesters were injured in the violence, in addition to 13 police officers.
The prosecution said it had retrieved birdshot canisters, tear gas canisters, Molotov cocktails and the burnt remains of protesters' tents from the vicinity of the palace.
Ten protesters in possession of Molotov cocktails and birdshot guns were detained outside the palace on Friday, the prosecution stated.
Five people have been arrested for setting fire to a school in downtown Cairo, near Simon Bolivar Square. Twenty others have been arrested for their involvement in skirmishes with the police.
