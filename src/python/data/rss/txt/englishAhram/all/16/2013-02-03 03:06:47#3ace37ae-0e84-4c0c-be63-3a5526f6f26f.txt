Trial of Mubarak-era 'thug' adjourned
Alexandria Criminal Court adjourns trial of notorious Mubarak-era 'thug', Sabri Nakhnoukh, on security grounds
The trial of infamous Mubarak-era 'thug' Sabri Nakhnoukh has been adjourned on security grounds.
Alexandria Criminal Court deferred the trial, which was due to begin on Sunday, to avoid transferring Nakhnoukh from Alexandria's Borg Al-Arab Prison to the court during the current period of unrest, said the defendant's lawyer, Maher Naime.
Nakhnoukh, who has admitted facilitating large-scale vote rigging in favour of the now-defunct National Democratic Party, was arrested in August 2012 at his private villa near Alexandria. He is facing a wide range of charges including "thuggery," unlicensed possession of weapons, drugs possession and involvement in prostitution.
Nakhnoukh claims the charges were trumped up by the Muslim Brotherhood.
The Islamist group has accused him of working with the Mubarak regime to kill protesters during the January 25 Revolution.
