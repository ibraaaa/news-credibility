Art Alert: Polish musicians to mark Lutoslawski anniversary at Cairo Opera House
In commemoration of composer/conductor Witold Lutoslawski's hundredth birth anniversary, Polish musicians will perform a selection of his works at the Cairo Opera House on Wednesday
In the classical music scene, 2013 marks a number of important anniversaries. Germans celebrate the 200th anniversary of the birth of Richard Wagner (1813-1883); Italians the birth of Giuseppe
(1813-1901); and Poles the 100th anniversary of the birth of one of the leading Polish composers and conductors Witold Lutoslawski (1913-1994).
Not only in Poland but across the world, Polish orchestras, small ensembles and soloists will perform works by Lutoslawski, a composer believed to have been one of the last devotees of what many see today as "old-fashion harmony."
"Music can have a multitude of dimensions," Lutoslawski was quoted as saying. "When it seems to be saying one thing, it delivers something completely different as if contradicting itself."
Joining the international celebrations, three Polish musicians – Szymon Klima on clarinet, Joachin Mencel on piano and Adam Kowalewski on contrabass – will perform a concert on Wednesday under the title 'Lutoslawski-Retuned' at the Cairo Opera House's small hall.
The concert will feature Lutoslawski's music being played with an innovative touch, blending classical music with jazz accents. 
Programme:
Wednesday, 6 February at 8pm
Small Hall, Cairo Opera House, Zamalek
