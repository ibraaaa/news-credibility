Tennis: Azarenka beats Williams to win Qatar Open
Azarenka extended her current winning streak to 14 matches
Defending champion Victoria Azarenka beat Serena Williams 7-6 (6), 2-6, 6-3 to win the Qatar Open on Sunday, earning her 16th title and ending a 10-match losing streak against the American.
Azarenka will give up the No. 1 ranking to Williams on Monday but extended her current winning streak to 14 matches, including her second Australian Open title. More importantly, she may have turned around what has been a one-sided rivalry against Williams. Azarenka had not beaten Williams since 2009 in Miami, and had a 1-11 record against the American going into Sunday's final.
Williams dominated the second set with her powerful serve and forehand, but Azarenka took a 5-2 lead in the third before clinching the victory.
