Libya Football Federation in talks with Egypt's Hassan Shehata
Libya are contacting Hassan Shehata and Bado El-Zaki for the first national team job
The Libyan Football Federation (LFF) have started negotiations with former Egypt manager Hassan Shehata to appoint him as Libyan national team coach ahead of 2014 World Cup qualifiers.
The 63-year-old Egyptian tactician Shehata, who inspired the Pharaohs to clinch three African Cup of Nation (CAN) trophies but failed to qualify for the fourth, has been out of action since he ended his last short spell at Al-Arabi of Qatar last December.
Shehata had a short coaching experience in the Arab country when he led Ahly of Bani Ghazi in 1999.
Libya are also contacting Moroccan Bado El-Zaki.
The country's team have been led by coach Abdel-Hafiz Arbish since the sacking of Brazilian Marcos Bakita after 2013 CAN. They will play Democratic Republic of Congo on 24 March in World Cup qualifiers .
