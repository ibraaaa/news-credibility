Egyptian journalists plan protests against Brotherhood 'attacks'
Journalists plan three protests to condemn Saturday night attacks on their colleagues by Muslim Brotherhood members
On Saturday afternoon, several people, including some journalists, were reportedly assaulted by Brotherhood members as protesters painted anti-Brotherhood graffiti on the perimeter of the group's HQ in Cairo's Moqattam district.
Furthermore, on Saturday evening, Brotherhood members reportedly attacked more journalists who were covering a meeting between Brotherhood Supreme Guide Mohamed Badie and Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal.
Diaa Rashwan, newly elected head of the Journalists' Syndicate, condemned the attacks on journalists and urged the Brotherhood's Supreme Guide Mohamed Badie to apologise.
Rashwan claimed the violence was carried out with the knowledge of – if not under orders from – the group's leaders. He also called on the presidency to condemn the assaults.
Journalists will protest at the Journalists' Syndicate in downtown Cairo on Sunday, at the prosecutor-general's office on Tuesday, and at the Brotherhood HQ on Wednesday.
Mona Mounir of the Free Egyptians Party condemned the violence, saying it "reveals the ugly face" of the Brotherhood.
"Attacks on women suggest we are facing militias trying to intimidate opponents of President Morsi and the Brotherhood Supreme Guide." 
A Brotherhood spokesperson, Yasser Mehrez, denied that his members intentionally attacked the journalists.
"Clashes erupted because some people tried to break into the Brotherhood’s headquarters. The young members of the Brotherhood did not intend to assault journalists or anyone else,” Mehrez said.
“Everybody has freedom of expression and the right to protest, but insults and sabotage are unacceptable," Mehrez added.
