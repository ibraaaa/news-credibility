Amr Zaki terminates contract with ENPPI
Ex-Zamalek star did it again leaving ENPPI after days of penning his contracts
Egypt striker Amr Zaki has terminated his contract with ENPPI Thursday, just two weeks after signing a two-year contract with them.
“I will reveal my new club within hours,” Zaki has reportedly said Thursday afternoon following complications sparked between him and ENPPI manager Tarek El-Ashry ahead of Bani Swif Telephones league game.
Last month, the former Zamalek star also terminated deal with Turkey's Elazigspor by mutual consent less than five months after signing.
The 29-year-old forward, who joined the Elazig-based club late August and was supposed to stay for two seasons, had agreed last month with the club to leave amicably and joined ENPPI in a free transfer.
He made eight appearances in the Turkish league. His last appearance came on 24 November against Galatasaray when he was substituted due to injury.
Zaki scored 36 goals for ENPPI during his previous stint at the petroleum club before moving to Zamalek in 2006, where he was loaned to English Premier League side Wigan Athletic in 2008-2009 and scored 11 goals in 33 matches.
He also had a short spell at Hull City where he made six appearances.
