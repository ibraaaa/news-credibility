Eight Ahly players to anchor Egypt football in Qatar friendly
No Zamalek, Ismaily or Europe-based players called for Egypt friendly against Qatar
Egypt manager Bob Bradley announced on Thursday the 18-man-squad for Qatar friendly to be held on 7 March in the Gulf country.
No Zamalek, Ismaily or foreign-based players were listed in the squad as they were excused for having crucial league games this week.
Meanwhile, eight Ahly players were called as their team enjoys a by-week in the Egyptian Premiere League.
The match, which will bring the Egyptian Football Association (EFA) 1 million Egyptian Pounds, wasn’t approved by FIFA.
The Pharoahs, winners of seven Africa Cup of Nations, are bidding for their first World Cup finals since 1990 when they meet Zimbabwe in the African qualifiers on 26 March.
Egypt tops qualifiers Group G with six points from two games, three ahead of second-placed Guinea. Zimbabwe and Mozambique hold one point each.
