Art Alert: Controversial Palestine film '5 Broken Cameras' to be screened in Cairo (VIDEO)
Dina's Hostel in downtown Cairo will show Oscar nominated Palestinian/Israeli documentary '5 Broken Cameras' this Sunday
The cultural programme at Dina's Hostel in downtown Cairo is set to host a film screening this Sunday of Oscar nominated documentary "5 Broken Cameras," directed by Palestinian Emad Burnat and Israeli Guy Davidi.
The film is a firsthand account of an attack by Israeli soldiers on the residents of a West Bank village, who were practising non-violent resistance in the face of the expansion of Israeli settlements.
The film's title refers to the number of cameras owned by Burnat, a resident of the village, that were broken by Israeli forces during the five years over which the film was shot.
Burnat, an olive picker, started filming for personal reasons, before getting Davidi to cooperate with him on the production of the film. The film was funded partially by the Israeli government, in spite of the fact that it criticises the Israeli army, causing controversy among both Palestinian and Israeli viewers.
The documentary has been highly acclaimed; apart from an Oscar nomination in the Documentary Feature category, "5 Broken Cameras" was featured in the 2012 Sundance Film Festival where it won the World Cinema Directing Award.
The film also won the Special Jury Award at the International Documentary Film Festival in Amsterdam in 2011.
Programme:
Sunday, 17 February at 7pm
Dina's Art Center, 42 Abdel-Khalek Tharwat, Downtown, Cairo
