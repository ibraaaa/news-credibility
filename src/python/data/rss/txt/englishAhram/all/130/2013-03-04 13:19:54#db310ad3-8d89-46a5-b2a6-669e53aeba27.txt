Kerry says finite amount of time for Iran nuke talks
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said on Monday there was a limited period of time available for talks between Iran and major powers about its disputed nuclear programme.
"There is a finite amount of time," Kerry, on a visit to Saudi Arabia, said of the talks between Tehran and a group of world powers. He was speaking at a news conference held jointly with his Saudi counterpart Prince Saud al-Faisal.
