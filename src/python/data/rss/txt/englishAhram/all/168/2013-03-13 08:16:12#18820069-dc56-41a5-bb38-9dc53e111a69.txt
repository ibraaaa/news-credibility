Holders Chelsea and Manchester United will replay their FA Cup quarter-final at Stamford Bridge on April 1, the Football Association said in a statement on Wednesday
The match, on the Easter Monday holiday, will kick off at 12.30 local.
Chelsea came from two goals down to draw 2-2 with the Premier League leaders at Old Trafford last Sunday. The winners will play Manchester City in the semi-finals.

The European champions are also still in the Europa League and have a last 16 second leg at home against Steaua Bucharest on Thursday that could lead to a quarter-final first leg on April 4.
