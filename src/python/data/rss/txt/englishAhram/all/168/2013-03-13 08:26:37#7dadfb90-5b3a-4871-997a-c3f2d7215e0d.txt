Galatasary will 'fight like lions' to reach semis: Ivory Coast's Drogba
Drogba delighted after Galatasaray clinched thrilling win over Germany's Schalke in the Champions League on Tuesday
Ivorian striker Didier Drogba said Galatsaray are eager to book a semi-final place at the European Champions League for the first time since 2001 after they eliminated Germany's Schalke to reach the quarter-finals on Tuesday.
The Turkish side, who were held to a 1-1 draw by visitors Shalke in the first leg, clinched a thrilling 3-2 victory in the return leg to go through 4-3 on aggregate.
"First off, it is a good result for us and I am delighted with the way we played," Drogba was quoted as saying by Sky Sports on Wednesday.
"We showed some character. Tonight, we came with a fantastic attitude."
The veteran striker, who helped his former club Chelsea win the Champions League title last year, said his side's new target is reaching the tournament's semi-finals.
"It is a very nice night. Everything went like we wanted and we believed in our triumph. I would like to thank the Turkish nation. Our hearts are with them," he added.
"Now, everybody is celebrating and dancing in the dressing room. Our new target is reaching the semi-finals. There will be really good teams in the next round but it will not matter who we are paired with.
"We can go on the pitch and fight like lions. We have already surpassed expectations."
