I chose Egypt over Denmark and Holland, says Eindhoven's Adel
New Egyptian under-20 midfielder Amir Adel is happy to be playing with Egypt in the African Championships
Egyptian footballer Amir Adel has said he is happy to compete in the African Championships.
"I was offered spots in the Danish and the Dutch national teams earlier but I preferred to play with Egypt," the 18-year-old player was quoted as saying by Al-Ahram Al-Reyady weekly magazine on Wednesday.
Dutch PSV Eindhoven's centre playmaker Amir Adel is one of the new faces that coach Rabie Yassin introduced in Egypt's under-20 squad for the African competition.
"My father [former Ahly player Adel Ahmed] is a friend of coach Yassin since they played together in the 1980s, and he recommended me to him," said Alexander Jacobsen, as the Dutch crowd know him, adding, "I am hoping I can be a helpful element to the team's success and continue down the road with them."
Egypt will play in Group A alongside hosts Algeria, Ghana and Benin in the tournament which is being held 16-30 March.
The forward, who also plays as right and left-winger, started his career at Denmark's FC Copenhagen and was known as Denmark's Ronaldinho as a youth player.
