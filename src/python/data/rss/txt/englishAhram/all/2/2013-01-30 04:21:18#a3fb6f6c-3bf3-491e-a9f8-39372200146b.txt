South Africa striker Majoro fit for CAN quarterfinal
Bafana Bafana forward Majoro has recovered from injury and ready to lead the team in CAN quarterfinal
South Africa striker Lehlohonolo Majoro has been passed fit for Saturday's Africa Cup of Nations quarter-final after a shin injury suffered last week, officials said on Wednesday.
Majoro scored for the hosts in their Group A match against Angola in Durban last Wednesday but had to go off near the end after a kick from the opposing goalkeeper left him with a cut on the shin that required stitches.
He missed Sunday's draw with Morocco which allowed South Africa to finish top of the group and reach a quarter-final meeting with Mali in Durban.
