In turnaround, Baradei calls for dialogue with presidency
After shunning earlier invitations to dialogue, Mohamed ElBaradei calls for meeting between his National Salvation Front, President Morsi and Egypt's other main political actors
"We need a meeting between the president, defence minister, interior minister, the ruling party [i.e., the Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party], the Salafist current and the NSF to take prompt actions to abort violence and start a serious discussion," ElBaradei declared via Twitter on Wednesday.
On Monday, the NSF – a coalition of parties and groups opposed to Morsi and Egypt's newly-approved constitution – again rejected an invitation by the presidency to hold talks aimed at halting the sporadic violence recently seen around the country.
In December, following mass protests that erupted after a controversial presidential decree, the NSF had similarly rejected Morsi's calls for dialogue. The front subsequently issued

for holding talks with the presidency.
Egypt has seen riots, anti-government protests and deadly clashes since Thursday night, the eve of the January 25 Revolution's second anniversary. Since then, over 50 people have been killed in Cairo, Suez, Port Said and Ismailia, while a state of emergency has been declared in the cities of Egypt's Suez Canal.
