UK embassy suspends visa applications in Cairo, Alexandria
British embassy visa services in Cairo and Alexandria are halted due to "current security situation"; UK Middle East minister expresses concern at ongoing violence
The British Embassy in Cairo announced Wednesday a suspension on new visa applications in Cairo and Alexandria due to the "current security situation."
The embassy said on its website that visa services will resume as soon as staff members finalise the backlog of current applications. Already-submitted applications will be considered "as soon as possible."
Alistair Burt, Britain's Foreign Office minister for the Middle East, issued a press release Saturday expressing his concern about violence that erupted during protests in Cairo marking the second anniversary of the January 25 Revolution. The briefing also included reference to unrest in Port Said.
“I am deeply concerned by reports of violent clashes resulting in a number of deaths and injuries, following demonstrations to mark the second anniversary of the January 25 Revolution and the verdict in the Port Said court case today," the British government's official website quoted Burt as saying.
