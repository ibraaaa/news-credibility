Suez governor may lift curfew
Governor of Suez says he might lift a widely ignored curfew imposed on the city by President Morsi
Suez Governor Samir Aglan has said he may lift the city's curfew and deploy more soldiers and police to ensure security.
On Sunday, President Morsi imposed a curfew from 9pm until 6am on Suez, Port Said and Ismailia to stop violent protests.
However, he has since said local governors can amend or cancel the curfew.
Residents in the three cities have broken the curfew with widespread protests.
Riots erupted in Port Said on Saturday after a court sentenced 21 local people to death for their role in a deadly football riot. Thirty-nine civilians and two police officers have died in the violence.
Ismailia and Suez have witnessed protests and clashes since the second anniversary of the January 25 Revolution on Friday. In Suez, nine people – including one police conscript – have been killed, while at least one civilian has been reported killed in Ismailia.
