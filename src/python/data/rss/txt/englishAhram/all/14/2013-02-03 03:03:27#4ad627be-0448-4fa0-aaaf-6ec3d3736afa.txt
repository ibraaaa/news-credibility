Ronaldo scores 1st own goal in Real Madrid loss to Granada
Real Madrid lose to Granada 1-0 in the 22nd matchday of the Spain La Liga on Saturday
Cristiano Ronaldo scored the first own goal of his otherwise stellar career to condemn Real Madrid to a 1-0 defeat at Granada on Saturday, as Jose Mourinho's side fell into the same funk that has dogged it all season against lesser-name opponents.
Ronaldo's career is packed with goals of all sorts and from all angles, but he had never in 10 and a half seasons found the back of his team's net until he headed a corner over goalkeeper Diego Lopez in a flubbed attempt to clear 22 minutes in.
Madrid's slip, however, rested on the entire team as the defending champions failed to get a shot on target until the 58th minute.
Madrid's fifth loss in 12 away games this season left it 15 points behind Barcelona before the Spanish league leader visits Valencia on Sunday.
