Rooney gives Manchester United 1-0 win at Fulham
Manchester United defeat Fulham 1-0 in the 25th matchday of the English Premier League on Saturday
Manchester United striker Wayne Rooney lit up Craven Cottage after a floodlight-failure delay on Saturday by clinching a 1-0 victory over Fulham that sent the leaders provisionally 10 points clear in the Premier League title race.
Rooney latched onto Jonny Evans' long ball and went through the Fulham defense before curling the ball in the bottom corner in the 79th minute.
It was Rooney's 10th goal in as many games, and the double-digit lead it secured over Manchester City will stay intact if the champions lose Sunday to Liverpool.
United's match looked in jeopardy in the 42nd minute when the floodlights went out at Fulham. The referee led the teams back down the tunnel before the lights came back and the match was resumed around 10 minutes later.
