Ahly’s Abdel-Zaher encouraged by goal against ex-club ENPPI
Forward Ahmed Abdel-Zaher is heartened after scoring first goal with Ahly during team's 2-1 league win against  player's former team ENPPI
"I thank God for winning these precious three points from this hard match from a really tough opponent," the 28-year-old told the club's official website following the match.
The occasional Egypt international has stirred controversy over his scoring abilities since moving to Ahly from ENPPI last January, but his important header in the 88th minute against his former club appeared to raise his spirits.
"I was confident that I would score against ENPPI after missing an opportunity," Abdel-Zaher said. "Da Silva prepared it for me very well and I, luckily, finished it."
Ahly, who are still missing a handful of key players, took an early lead with a close-range shot by defensive midfielder Rami Rabeia, but Abdallah El-Shahat drew ENPPI level at the 70th minute.
The win lifted Ahly – who made their worst league start since 2003 due to two defeats in their first five matches – to second place in Group A with 12 points, just behind leaders ENPPI on goal difference.
"I hope to bring something to my team in the crucial upcoming period," the former Baladeyet El-Mahalla star concluded.
African champion Ahly will kick off their title defence against Kenyan side Tusker in the 32nd round of the CAF Champions League on Sunday.
