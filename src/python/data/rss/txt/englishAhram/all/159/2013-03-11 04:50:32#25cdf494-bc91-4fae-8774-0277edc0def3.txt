Turkey arrests four Syrians over deadly border attack
Turkish security forces arrested Monday four Syrians linked to President Bashar al-Assad's regime over a deadly bomb attack on the border last month, the interior minister said.
"Our security forces arrested four Syrian nationals and one Turkish citizen" in connection with the February 11 minibus bombing which killed 14 people, Muammer Guler said in televised remarks. "We proved their links with the Syrian intelligence and army."
