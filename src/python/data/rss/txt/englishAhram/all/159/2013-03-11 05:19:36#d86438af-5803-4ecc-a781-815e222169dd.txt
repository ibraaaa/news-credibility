Despite instability, Egypt to host Zimbabwe World Cup qualifier
CAF president confirms Egypt vs. Zimbabwe match in the World Cup qualifiers will be played in Alexandria
The president of the Confederation of African Football, Cameroonian Issa Hayatou, has announced the third round match of the 2014 World Cup qualifiers between Egypt and Zimbabwe will be held in Alexandria despite angry football fans torching the Egyptian Football Association headquarters during protests against the Port Said ruling.
"CAF president Issa Hayatou revealed his support for the Egyptian Football Association, after the riots, during a telephone call with the association's president," read a statement on the EFA official website on Monday.
On Saturday, Egypt’s court confirmed the death sentences for 21 defendants originally announced on 26 January.
 
On Saturday, hundreds of hardcore Ahly fans, Ultras Ahlaw, are reported to have torched the EFA headquarters in an angry reaction to the verdict.
Zimbabwe had asked for their qualifier against Egypt on the 26 March to be held outside Egypt due the current unrest in the country.
"Hayatou confirmed Egypt vs. Zimbabwe will be played in Alexandria as it was scheduled before," the statement added.
Egypt tops Group G in the qualifiers with six points from two games, three ahead of Guinea, who is in second place. Zimbabwe and Mozambique hold one point each. The winners of seven African Cup of Nations titles, Egypt is bidding for its first World Cup since 1990.
