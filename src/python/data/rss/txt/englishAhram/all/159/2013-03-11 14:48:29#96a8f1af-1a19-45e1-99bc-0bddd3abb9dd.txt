Microbus driver strikes in Cairo partially contained
Many microbus drivers, enraged at diesel shortages, are continuing their strike action; others call it off after obtaining necessary fuel
Egyptian microbus drivers are continuing to block major roads in a second day of their strike action against diesel fuel shortages.
Among areas that have been blockaded by drivers on Monday are Giza's Sahel Bridge, Ahmed Helmy Street in Cairo's Shubra district, Imbaba Bridge, and 10th Ramadan and Ahmed Helmy stations, said Cairo traffic chief Major General Hassan El-Bardeesy.
Traffic officers managed to coax the protesting drivers into reopening Ahmed Helmy Street and Sahel Bridge after providing them with the necessary fuel.
Directives have been issued to oil companies to urgently provide additional fuel in areas experiencing strikes.
Microbus drivers across Cairo and Giza began strike action on Sunday to protest the lack of fuel.
Egypt has been hampered by fuel shortages since the 25 January revolution.
The country's fuel subsidies make up approximately half of the total subsidies allocated in the state budget.
