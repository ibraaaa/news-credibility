Egypt's new Grand Mufti, Shawki Ibrahim Abdel-Karim has been officially approved by President Mohamed Morsi, the presidential office confirms in a press statement released on Monday.
The Senior Scholars Authority of Al-Azhar, the Sunni Muslim world's religious authority, met to choose the new Grand Mufti to succeed Ali Gomaa, who has recently retired.

Following the vote, Morsi was expected to officially approve the decision for Abdel-Karim to officially carry out his post starting from 4 March.
Abdel-Karim, 55, most recently served as the head of the Islamic Jurisprudence and Sharia Law at Al-Azhar University, Tanta branch.
The new Mufti was born in the Nile Delta governorate of Beheira and received his PhD in 1996 from the Al-Azhar University Faculty of Sharia and Law.

Al-Azhar is the main source of religious edicts for Sunni Muslims worldwide and the post of Grand Mufti was created in 1895. Abdel-Karim is the 19th to hold the post of Grand Mufti.
