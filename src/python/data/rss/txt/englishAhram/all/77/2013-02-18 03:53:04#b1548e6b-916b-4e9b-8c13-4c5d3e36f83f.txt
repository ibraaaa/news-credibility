Art Alert: Egyptian and German artists collaborate in intercultural project
'InterLAB: Artificial Emotional Intelligence' interactive art project brings emerging media artists and computer scientists from Cairo and Dresden together in parallel events held in the two cities
Egyptian cultural organisation Medrar for Contemporary Art is hosting a two-day interactive exhibition on Friday, 22 February and Saturday, 23 February entitled 'InterLAB: Artificial Emotional Intelligence.' The exhibition is the outcome of a collaborative art project between Egyptian and German artists.
The interactive show, which provides an online platform for creative interaction between artists from Cairo and Dresden, will take place in the two cities simultaneously and will encourage participation from the public.
'
InterLAB' is the product of online exchange and communication between five Egyptian artists and computer scientists and five German counterparts. They collaborated to create "an interactive space dedicated to alternative ways for communication."
"Many questions emerged during this process," says the Medrar for Contemporary Art Facebook event. "The most crucial one focused on the exploration of what, beyond text and speech, is needed in order to not only communicate, but also understand each other."
The new media artists and computer scientists, who represent OpenLabEgypt and the German collective Kazoosh, have created futuristic tools that trigger new modes of communication.
Created and managed by Dia Hamed and Joanna Szlauderbach, the experimental project is sponsored by the Cultural Resource (Al Mawred Al Thaqafy), the European Cultural Foundation, Norweigan non-profit Mimeta, the Dutch Stichting Doen Foundation and German organisations promoting cross-cultural dialogue;  MitOst, Robert Bosh Stifung.
Programme:
Friday, 22 February, 9pm to 11pm
Saturday, 23 February, 6pm to 9pm
