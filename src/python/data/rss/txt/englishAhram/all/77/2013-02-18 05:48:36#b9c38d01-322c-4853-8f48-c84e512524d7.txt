Seven to hang for Sudan child rape, lawyer says
Seven men to be hanged in Sudan for raping a 14-year-old girl in May last year
A Sudanese judge sentenced seven men to hang for the drugging and rape of a 14-year-old girl, the victim's lawyer said on Monday, calling the sentence "more than just".
Cases of gang rape are rare in the Islamist-run state.
Six minors who also abused the girl were sentenced to 10 years each in a reformatory, Judge Ahmed Khalil Albahar ruled, according to the lawyer Salma Mohammedahmed Hamed.
"He found them guilty by the evidence he received of raping a child," the lawyer told AFP.
Judge Albahar issued the verdict on Sunday at a court in Khartoum's twin city of Omdurman, Hamed said.
The crime occurred in May last year after the men kidnapped the girl from her home. All 13 of them abused her.
"They gave her a cup of juice containing drugs and then raped her," Hamed said.
In his verdict, the judge cited a presidential directive calling for heavier punishments of sex crimes.
Hamed said the girl was treated at a rape trauma centre and has returned to school.
