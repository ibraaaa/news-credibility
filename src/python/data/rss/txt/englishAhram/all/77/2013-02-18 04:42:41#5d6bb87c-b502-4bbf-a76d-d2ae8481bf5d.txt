7-0 win over Nguema not enough for Kotoko’s Dramani
Coach Mas-Ud Dramani thinks Asante Kotoko should focus on improving their striking despite clobbering Sony Nguema 7-0 in CAF Champions League on Sunday
Ghana champions Asante Kotoko coach Mas-Ud Dramani is not satisfied despite their 7-0 victory over Sony Nguema on Sunday in CAF Champions League preliminary round.
"It is a good win, but we need to improve on our striking," the coach told the Ghanaian media after the match.
Kofi Nti-Boakye, Michael Anaba, Abdul Aziz Yusif, Richard Mpong, Michael Helegbe, Seidu Bancey and Joseph Ochaya scored for Kotok, but they missed many other chances.
"We could have scored more goals, but we had the inability to finish off some of our moves," Dramani said. "This is something we need to work on before the second leg."
The Ghanaian champions are traveling to Equatorial Guinea for the second leg.
In the same competition, Egyptian giants Zamalek also won 7-0 against Chad’s Gazelle.
