Art Alert: Teatro Alexandria hosts open mic night
One of Alexandria's newest culture hubs, Teatro, collaborates with Mashrou' El-Mareekh to host their famous open mic night on 19 February
Mashrou' El-Mareekh (The Mars Project) holds their famous open mic night, where each person gets five minutes of uninterrupted attention, at Teatro Alexandria.
The group has been organising open mic nights regularly in Cairo and all over the country for the past three years. Their platform is not merely to display talent, even though it does, but rather to give space for people to express their inner-most self in a safe, judgement-free environment.
Teatro Alexandria has previously hosted several open mic nights in cooperation with Mashrou' El Mareekh. Teatro is a cafe and restaurant that hosts an array of culture programmes, including open mic nights, open jams, film screenings, workshops and concerts for independent musicians.
Programme:
Tuesday, 19 February at 7pm
25 Fouad Street, Downtown, Alexandria
