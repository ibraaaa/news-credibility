Families of Egypt balloon victims to receive $1.2mn compensation
Families of 19 tourists who were killed in balloon crash in Upper Egypt will receive compensation totaling $1.2 million
A company that was in charge of a balloon that crashed in Luxor, Upper Egypt, said the victims' families would receive roughly LE8.4 million ($1.2 million) in compensations, Ahram's Arabic-language news website reported on Saturday.
Mona Maher, the director of SkyTours, the Luxor-based company and the hot-air balloon’s operator, stated that the compensations have been set under terms of the Egyptian insurance document.
Maher added that the working licence of the company that was established in 2003 is valid until 25 March.
She went on to point out that the company, as a balloon operator, is subject to regular assessments, with the last one being carried out on 14 February.
SkyTours did not commit any errors that would threaten the security of the tourists, Maher said.
Nineteen people were killed in the tragedy.
On Wednesday, a British balloon expert said hot air balloon pilots in Egypt have "very weak" training.
The Egyptian government opened an investigation into the tragedy but no reports have been available yet.
Meanwhile, Japan, which lost four of its citizens in the crash, sent a team of security specialists to aid in the investigation.
