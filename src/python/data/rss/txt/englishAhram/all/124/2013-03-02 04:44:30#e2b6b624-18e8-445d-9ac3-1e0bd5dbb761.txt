Senegal's Cisse prepares to fill Demba's boots at Newcastle
After a difficult low season for the Senegalese striker, he relishes his new challenge with Newcastle
Senegal striker Papiss Cisse believes he has a new responsibility to fill the space that his fellow countryman Demba Ba left at Newcastle United after departing for Chelsea this winter.
The 27-year-old hitman, who joined the Magpies last year from SC Freiburg, wants to repay Alan Pardew for his confidence in him as first choice on the attacking line after Ba's exit.
"Mentally, I am definitely in a different position to where I was. There is more responsibility on my shoulders and I relish it," the Senegalese player told Daily Star.
"Between Shola Ameobi and myself, we have to fill Demba's boots, but the new players have come in and helped us a lot. I think the team is in a really strong position right now," he added.
Seeing himself scoring only eight times in 33 matches this season, Cisse acknowledges it is a difficult experience, especially compared to last year when he scored 13 times in 14 games.
"I haven't perhaps done as well as I would have hoped, nor scored as many goals as I would have liked, but that's the nature of the job," Cisse explained.
"You have ups and downs and you have to be mentally strong to get through it," he concluded.
