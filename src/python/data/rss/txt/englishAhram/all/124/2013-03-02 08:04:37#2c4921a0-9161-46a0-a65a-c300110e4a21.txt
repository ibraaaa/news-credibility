Egypt’s Zamalek reach Champions League round of 32
Egypt’s Zamalek play out a goalless draw with Gazelle of Chad to go through with an emphatic 7-0 aggregate victory
Egyptian side Zamalek smoothly qualified for the African Champions League round of 32 following a goalless draw at Chad’s Gazelle on Saturday.
The game was a mere formality after the Cairo giants thumped Gazelle 7-0 in Alexandria in the first leg of the preliminary round two weeks ago.
Chances were few and far between in a game played in an extremely hot weather.
It was Zamalek’s first draw this season, having made a superb start to their Egyptian Premier League campaign after winning their first five games.
The White Knights are bidding to win their first Champions League title since 2002. They have five titles under their belt, two behind arch-rivals and traditional foes Ahly.
