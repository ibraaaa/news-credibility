Greece 'ready' to absorb Cyprus bank subsidiaries: minister
Greece will take over assets and liabilities of three Cypriot banks in Greece if the proposed bank deposits tax is implemented
Athens was "ready" to absorb the subsidiaries of three Cyprus banks active in Greece, the Greek finance minister said as the eurozone sought to amend a controversial levy on the island nation's bank deposits.
"We stand ready to take over the assets and liabilities of Cypriot branches in Greece," Finance Minister Yannis Stournaras said late on Monday.
Cypriot bank subsidiaries in Greece are exempt from the levy, Stournaras added.
There are three Cypriot banks with subsidiaries in Greece: the Bank of Cyprus, the Hellenic Bank and the Cyprus Popular Bank (CPB).
Under the original terms of a 10-billion euro ($13 billion) bailout package from the eurozone, all holders of bank accounts in Cyprus were to be hit by a one-off levy ranging from 6.75 percent to 9.9 percent.
On Tuesday, French Finance Minister Pierre Moscovici said the eurozone had "unanimously" agreed to scrap the controversial levy on deposits below 100,000 euros for a bailout to the debt-hit nation.
All Cypriot subsidiaries in Greece were closed on Tuesday -- the first day of business after a religious holiday on Monday.
The Athens stock exchange said it had also temporarily suspended trading in Bank of Cyprus and CPB shares.
