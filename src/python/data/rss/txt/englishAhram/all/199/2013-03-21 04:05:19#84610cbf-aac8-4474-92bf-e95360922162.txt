Germany will take on Ecuador in May and the United States in June during an 11-day U.S. trip, the German soccer association said on Thursday.
The three-time world and European champions will play Ecuador in Boca Raton, Florida, on 29 May, a week after arriving as part of the centennial anniversary celebrations for the US federation.
They will play former coach Juergen Klinsmann's U.S. team in Washington on 2 June before returning to Germany four days later.
World Cup winner Klinsmann coached Germany between 2004-2006 and led them to the 2006 World Cup semi-finals.
