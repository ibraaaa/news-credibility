Lynch mob kills man in Egypt's Nile Delta
Alleged thief killed by lynch mob in Sharqiya governorate in latest such incident in Egypt this week
Dozens of people chased the man before tying him to a tree and beating him to death in El-Guindiya village in Sharqiya governorate.
It is the latest in a number of such incidents since the revolution in early 2011. Under Islamic law 'highwaymen' can be killed, crucified or have their hand or foot amputated.
On Sunday, two men accused of abducting two young boys were beaten to death, stripped half-naked and hung from a tree by vigilantes in front of thousands of onlookers in Sammound village in Gharbiya governorate.
Justice Minister Ahmed Mekki said the lynching in Sammound was a sign of "the death of the state."
On Monday, hundreds of people in Mahallah Ziad village in Gharbiya governorate surrounded a police station in an attempt to capture and execute a man charged with kidnapping a local girl.
The lynchings come against the backdrop of a call by the attorney general's office for civilians to arrest lawbreakers and hand them over to police. The country's difficult security situation has been exacerbated by a police strike.
Al-Gamaa Al-Islamiya has offered to replace the striking police and the Muslim Brotherhood has proposed giving private security firms the right to carry arms and make arrests.
