Hundreds of Egyptian protesters demonstrate at Qubba presidential palace
Anti-Morsi protesters have gathered at Qubba presidential palace in Heliopolis where Morsi has moved his administration
Hundreds of opposition protesters have gathered at the Qubba presidential palace in Heliopolis to stage a protest against the government of President Morsi.
After recent clashes in front of the Etahadeya presidential palace, Morsi moved his administration to the Qubba palace. Both palaces are in the Heliopolis district of Cairo.
More marches are expected to arrive from several different districts of Cairo.
The protesters are demanding the dismissal of the current government of Prime Minister Hisham Qandil and asking that President Morsi brings justice to all the protesters who have died since the 25 January revolution began in 2011.
They also condemned the recent acquittal and release of former regime figures.
In recent weeks, former speaker of the Shura Council Safwat El-Sherif, chief of Mubarak's staff Zakaria Azmi, former minister of interior Habib El-Adly, former prime minister Ahmed Nazif and former tourism minister Zohair Garana have all been released pending retrials.
Earlier on Friday, the presidential guard secured the palace gates with barricades.
There are no security forces currently on the scene according to eyewitnesses.
