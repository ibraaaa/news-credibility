Egypt's Chief of Staff  travelling to UAE to meet officials
Sedki Sobhi will hold meetings with high-ranking officials from the Emirati armed forces
Egypt's Chief of Staff Sedki Sobhi will travel to Abu Dhabi, capital of the United Arab Emirates, on Friday with a military delegation for several days to meet with a number of high-ranking officials in the Emirati armed forces.
Sobhi will also attend an international defence conference in the city on Monday.
Delegations from around 80 countries will be attending the conference.
Last month, local media reported that UAE authorities had arrested 11 Egyptians residing in the country on suspicions of links to the Brotherhood.
The case sparked a sharp deterioration of relations between Abu Dhabi and Cairo, which were already under strain since Brotherhood candidate Morsi's election as president last June.
