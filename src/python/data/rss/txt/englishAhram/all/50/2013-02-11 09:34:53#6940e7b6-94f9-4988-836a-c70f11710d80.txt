Quick! What do I do on Valentines 2013?
Everything from Salsa dance events, to exciting nights at Buddha Bar and Tamerai to an ANTI-Valentines night
Single and don’t want to deal with the heart decorations? Try:
Anti-Valentines Day at Cairo Jazz Club, Mohandessin
11:00pm – 4:00am
The night for singles, where DJ Ramy will spin UP-beats. Great night for singles, but the guys-must-be-accompanied-by-a-female rule still applies.
