Egypt must keep economic reforms in line with political imperatives: IMF

"We understand that the Egyptian authorities are in the process of updating their economic programme and adapting it to current economic circumstances," Wafa Amr, senior IMF press officer, said in an emailed statement.
The government has since failed to implement the tax raises, but has launched a "social dialogue" to discuss the planned measures.

Egypt's currency lost some 8 per cent of its value since the beginning of 2013, after the central bank implied it would not be able to freely support the Egyptian pound due to post-revolution declines in the country's foreign currency reserves.
Egypt's severe fiscal troubles were triggered by the instability that followed the Tahrir Square uprising that unseated Hosni Mubarak in early 2011 and which has taken a heavy toll on the country's tourism sector and investment receipts.
