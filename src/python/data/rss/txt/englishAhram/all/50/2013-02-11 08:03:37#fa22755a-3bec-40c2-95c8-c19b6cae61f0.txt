Prosecutor-general orders arrest of  'kill opposition leaders' sheikh
Talaat Abdullah orders authorities to arrest Azhar professor Mahmoud Shaaban who called for the killing of ElBaradei and Sabbahi
The prosecutor General office ordered the arrest of Al-Azhar University professor Mahmoud Shaaban for his controversial fatwa which stipulated Egyptian opposition leaders should be punished by death for attempting to bring down a leader elected by the public.
Shaaban, a fiery Salafist preacher, issued the religious
edict
last week on a television show he hosts on the Islamic satellite Al-Hafez channel granting a green light for the killing of the National Salvation Front (NSF) leaders Mohamed ElBaradei and Hamdeen Sabbahi.
Lawyer Khaled Taher filed a complaint against Shabaan accusing him of inciting murder.
Shabaan's statements triggered condemnations from a large number of Egyptian figures, Islamists and non-Islamists alike.
Prime Minister Hesham Qandil expressed his rejection of such "extreme" statements, stating that such statements directly incite murder and raise dissent and unrest in the country.
