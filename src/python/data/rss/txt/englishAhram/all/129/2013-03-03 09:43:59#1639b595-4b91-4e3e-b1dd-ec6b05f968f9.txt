Locusts attack agricultural lands in Egypt's Suez governorate
After attacking in eastern Cairo on Sunday morning, locusts head to Suez governorate threatening agricultural land
Swarms of locusts attacked agricultural land in El-Raed and Youssef El-Sabae villages in Suez governorate on Sunday afternoon.
Ahmed El Sharkawy, one of the farmers in Suez, told Ahram Arabic gate that the farmers were asking the governorate and the anti-locusts department in the ministry of agriculture to act quickly.
"We have 40,000 acres that can be completely destroyed by locusts."
Some farmers accused government officials of not taking any precautions to limit numbers of locusts which managed to reach Suez.
The locusts attacked El-Obour market in Cairo on Sunday morning. They have made their way up north in the past few days striking along the way in the governorates of Red Sea and Qena.
