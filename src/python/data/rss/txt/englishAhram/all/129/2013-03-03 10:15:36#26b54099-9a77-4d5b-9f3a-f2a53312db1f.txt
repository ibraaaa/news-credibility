Syria opposition chief makes first Aleppo visit
The leader of the Syrian National Coalition, Ahmed Moaz al-Khatib, paid a visit to city of Aleppo to meet with activists and rebel fighters on the ground
Syria's opposition chief Ahmed Moaz al-Khatib made a first visit to the largely rebel-held northern province of Aleppo on Sunday, an opposition source told AFP.
"Khatib entered the country for a few hours on Sunday morning for the first time" since becoming head of the Syrian National Coalition in November, the source said on condition of anonymity.
"He visited Menbej and Jarablos to view the situation of residents there and to discuss their living conditions," said the official, referring to towns in Aleppo province.
"Khatib also held meetings with local officials in the two towns to discuss the (Aleppo) provincial election that is being held today (Sunday)" in the Turkish town of Gaziantep, the official said.
The opposition-organised election for a council for the province of Aleppo is being held in Gaziantep for security reasons.
"People in liberated areas live in difficult conditions, and Khatib's visit was part of an effort (by the opposition) to better coordinate affairs for citizens in these areas," the official added.
Amateur video footage distributed by activists show Khatib walking through the streets of Menbej, according to an unidentified cameraman.
The video shows Khatib, in a dark suit and scarf, accompanied by several men through a street lined with small shops.
One man is seen as recognising him and embracing Khatib, prompting others to do the same. Other passers-by stop Khatib and pose for a photograph with him.
