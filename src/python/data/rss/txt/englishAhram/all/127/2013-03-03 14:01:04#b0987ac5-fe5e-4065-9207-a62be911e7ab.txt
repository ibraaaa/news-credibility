Swarms of locusts attack El-Obour Market in Cairo
Locust plague reaches the capital destroying agricultural products at market in eastern Cairo Sunday morning
Swarms of locusts attacked El-Obour vegetable and fruit market in Cairo on Sunday morning, destroying the agricultural products.
Traders responded promptly, however, and safeguarding vegetable and fruit stocks. Other traders burned tyres around the market to create a black fog to repel the locust invasion.
The market's administration notified the Cairo governorate and the agriculture ministry. Agriculture specialists are expected to be sent and take all necessary measures to limit the incurring damage to the market's crops, said Ibrahim El Haddad, one of the market's biggest traders.
Experts assert that locusts are not dangerous to humans and that the agriculture ministry is currently taking the necessary measures to prevent the pests from settling in Egypt.
This is the normal locust migration route for this time of the year and it is not expected that their passage be destructive, since they have already satisfied their nutritional needs, explained Mohamed Tawfik, the former head of the locust prevention division at the agriculture ministry.
Locusts were spotted in several Cairo districts on Saturday, including Mokattam and New Cairo.
