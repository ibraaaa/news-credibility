Ultras Ahlawy besiege central bank in Cairo
Egypt's central bank surrounded by protesters demanding strong sentences on interior ministry and Masry football club officials for the killing of Ahly fans in Port Said disaster
Around 600 members of Ultras Ahlawy have surrounded the Central Bank of Egypt in downtown Cairo, blocking access to the building and halting traffic.
The hardcore supporters of Ahly football club are demanding harsh sentences on interior ministry and Masry football club officials for their roles in the Port Said disaster.
A court will issue its verdict on the officials on 9 March.
In January, the court sentenced 21 Masry fans, some of them minors, to death for their role in the disaster, a decision that sparked violent clashes in the Canal city.
Security forces have asked the protesters to allow the free movement of people in and out of the central bank, which was halted at around 11 this morning, Al-Ahram Arabic website reported.
Over 70 Ahly fans died when they were attacked by Masry supporters in the Port Said Stadium in February 2012.
