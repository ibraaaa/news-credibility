Egypt goal-machine Gedo set to stay with Hull City
Hull City is ready to show Ahly the money if Egypt's Gedo maintains current goal-scoring run to help team book place in Premier League, UK press reports
The Egypt and Hull City forward has voiced stepped-up interest in staying in England after scoring his fourth goal with Hull since joining them last January.
"I have a great life here; I want to continue my career in Hull City," Gedo was quoted as saying by the Mirror.
"I hope not to go back to Egypt now. I have to score more goals for the [Hull City] coach, who has shown so much faith in me and this team," he added.
The 28-year-old attacker continued his blistering goal-scoring run in the English second division after helping Hull City thrash Birmingham 5-2 on Saturday.
Gedo doubled Hull's advantage after 11 minutes with a clear-cut shot from inside the area, adding the fifth with a powerful header 14 minutes from time after being set up by compatriot Ahmed Elmohamady.
"I want to please Hull fans who have supported me since I came to England," the Egyptian forward said.
Gedo, who is on loan from Egyptian champions Ahly, also found the net in Hull’s 2-1 win over Derby County, their 1-0 victory over Charlton Athletic and their 2-0 win of Blackburn Rovers.
Hull are currently second in the championship table with 65 points, five behind leaders Cardiff City. The top two will both be promoted to the elite Premier League.
