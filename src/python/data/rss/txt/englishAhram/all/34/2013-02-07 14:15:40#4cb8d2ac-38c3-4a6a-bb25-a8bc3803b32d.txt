Egyptian FA backs coach Bradley despite recent slump
Offloading Bradley from his post as Egypt's coach is not on the table, says EFA member
The Egyptian Football Association (EFA) has revealed that it will continue supporting national team coach Bob Bradley to take his team to the 2014 World Cup finals in Brazil.
"Releasing Bradley from his post as national team tactician is not in our options," EFA member Ahmed Megahed told a television programme.
The Pharaohs continued their recent slump with a 2-1 defeat by Chile in a friendly game at Spain’s Vicente Calderon Stadium on Wednesday, after suffering an embarrassing 3-0 defeat by Ghana and losing 4-2 to the Ivory Coast in January. 
"The friendlies’ results won't affect the EFA decision on the American coach," he said.
Under the helm of American Bradley, the Egyptian national team are preparing for a World Cup qualifier at home to Zimbabwe next month.
They top their group in the qualifiers with six points from two games, three ahead of second-placed Guinea. Zimbabwe and Mozambique have one point apiece.
"The EFA members are supporting the Egyptian national team technical staff to beat Zimbabwe in the World Cup qualifiers," Megahed concluded.
