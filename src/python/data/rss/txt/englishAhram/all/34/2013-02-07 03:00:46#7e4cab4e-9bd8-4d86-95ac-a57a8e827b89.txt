Burkina Faso coach praises players for Ghana win
Burkina Faso coach believes his team's players deserved their place in upcoming CAN 213 semis
Having beaten Ghana 3-2 on penalties after full-time play ended with a 1-1 draw, Burkina Faso coach Paul Put believes that his team earned the victory.
"It was a tough game but we deserved to win," Put told the post-game press conference.
Burkina Faso rallied after conceding an early penalty, the start of a series of controversial decisions, one of which resulted in Ghana taking a 13th-minute lead through Mubarak Wakaso.
"We were upset with the penalty given to Ghana but I told my players at half-time that we need to forget about it and continue to fight," Put added.
"I am happy with the win but I am more happy for the players and the people of Burkina Faso," the tactician concluded.
The Stallions won their group, eliminating defending champions Zambia, and are scheduled to face Nigeria in the CAN 2013 final game on Sunday.
