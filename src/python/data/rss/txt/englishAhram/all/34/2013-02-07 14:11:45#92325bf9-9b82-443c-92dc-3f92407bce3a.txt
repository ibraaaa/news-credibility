Fujitsu cutting 5,000 jobs in restructuring
The Japanese electronics maker to slash 3 per cent of its workforce
Fujitsu said Thursday the job cuts will be completed by the end of this fiscal year next month, and will rely on early retirement, layoffs and other methods. Details were undecided.
Separately, another 4,500 workers will be shifted to other parts of Fujitsu, including a computer chip company being set up with Panasonic Corp., another languishing Japanese electronics maker

Japan's electronics sector has been floundering, although it's getting a boost recently from the weakening yen.
Last year, Japanese chip maker Elpida Memory filed for bankruptcy after amassing debts from nose-diving prices and competition from Korean rival Samsung.
