AC Milan's Boateng to take part in UN anti-racism event
Ghanaian midfielder will take part in a 'Racism and Sport' discussion in Geneva
AC Milan player Kevin-Prince Boateng, who led teammates off the field to protest being abused by fans in January, will take part in a United Nations event next week discussing racism in sport.
The U.N.'s human rights office said Tuesday that Boateng and former France captain Patrick Vieira will attend its "Racism and Sport" discussion on March 21.
U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay will open the 90-minute session at the U.N.'s European headquarters in Geneva.
Boateng is also scheduled to meet FIFA President Sepp Blatter the next day in Zurich.
Blatter initially questioned Boateng's actions in walking off following racist abuse by fans of Italian fourth-tier team Pro Patria during a friendly match.
Blatter later praised Boateng's "courageous" stand and has created a FIFA anti-racism task force which could recommend tougher sanctions for clubs and national teams whose fans racially insult players.
FIFA is sending its head of social responsibility programs, Federico Addiechi, to the Geneva meeting, the U.N. Office said.
European football's top anti-discrimination adviser, Piara Powar, is also scheduled to attend.
Powar is director of Fare, a network of fans' activist groups, whose stadium monitors have helped UEFA prosecute cases of abuse targeted at Italy forward Mario Balotelli at the 2012 European Championship.
Monitors also work at high-risk Champions League and Europa League matches.
