Egypt's Ismaily close on Arab Cup final after draw in Algeria
Ismaily's goalless draw away to Algerian side USMA makes them favorites to reach the final of the regional tournament
Egypt's Ismaily gained a first-leg advantage in the Arab Cup's semis following a goalless draw against USMA in Algeria on Tuesday.
The Egyptian sole representative in the regional tournament could have also snatched a win in the second half but Essam Ali spurned a clear-cut chance.
Ismaily were forced to make an unscripted substitution when main striker Ahmed Ali, who scored a stunning goal in a league victory over Arab Contractors last week, picked up an injury after eight minutes. He was replaced with Ghanaian striker John Antwi.
The second leg will be played in Ismailia on 2 April.
