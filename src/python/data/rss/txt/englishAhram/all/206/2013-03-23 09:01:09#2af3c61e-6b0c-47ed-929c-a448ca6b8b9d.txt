Eto'o scores twice as Cameroon overcome Togo scare in World Cup qualifiers
The Cameroon skipper impresses despite problems with the country's football federation to guide his side to a 2-1 home victory over Togo in the World Cup qualifiers
Talisman Samuel Eto'o, who stirred controversy last month after claiming that some Cameroon football officials "want him dead", notched a brace to lead the Indomitable Lions to a 2-1 win over Togo in the World Cup qualifying Group I on Saturday.
The 32-year-old converted a penalty three minutes before the break but Togo leveled the score on 47 minutes, thanks to a goal from Dave Wome.
However, Eto'o, who was called up to the team's squad despite his shock assertions, came to Cameroon's rescue with a 72
-minute strike to help his side move two points clear on top of the group.
Cameroon, who have not played at the last two African Nations Cups, have six points from three games, two ahead of second-placed Libya, who face the Democratic Republic of Congo on Sunday. Togo have a solitary point. 
The group winners will advance to a decisive two-legged playoff that will determine Africa's five representatives at next year's World Cup in Brazil.
