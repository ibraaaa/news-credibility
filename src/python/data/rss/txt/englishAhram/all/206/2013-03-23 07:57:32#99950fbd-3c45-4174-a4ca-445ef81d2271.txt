ElBaradei condemns violence, slams regime and police
NSF leader denounces use of violence near Muslim Brotherhood HQ in Cairo blaming government for failing to deal with 'root causes'
Leading opposition figure and founder of the Constitution Party Mohamed ElBaradei voiced discontent with the violence that erupted on Friday near the Muslim Brotherhood's main headquarters in Cairo's Mokattam.
"Violence will bring violence, and the nation’s misery will not be solved with violence," said ElBaradei via twitter on Saturday.
Nationwide clashes between protesters and Muslim Brotherhood members in front of the group’s main headquarter in Cairo's Mokattam and several other cities on Friday left at least 200 injured.
The clashes erupted after several opposition activists had called for protests to be held on Friday in response to an attack by Muslim Brotherhood members on anti-Brotherhood protesters and graffiti artists outside the Islamist group's building on 16 March.
Several opposition groups responded to the call for protests, including the youth of the Egyptian Social Democratic Party, the Free Egyptians Party, and the Constitution Party, all of which are under the umbrella of the National Salvation Front (NSF) opposition group.
ElBaradei, leading member of the NSF, further denounced the failure of security forces in handling protests and the regime’s failure to "address root causes of mounting anger."
"The regime is responsible for protecting citizens and dealing with the reasons that have led to violence," added ElBaradei.
