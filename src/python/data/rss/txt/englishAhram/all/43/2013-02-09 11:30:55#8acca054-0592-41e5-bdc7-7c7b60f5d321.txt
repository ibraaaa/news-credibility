Juventus beat Fiorentina 2-0 to extend Serie A lead
Vucinic and Matri on score as Juventus defeat Fiorentina 2-0 in the 24th matchday of the Serie A on Saturday
Juventus moved six points clear at the top of Serie A by comfortably beating Fiorentina 2-0 thanks to first-half goals from Mirko Vucinic and Alessandro Matri in Turin on Saturday.
The win takes the champions to 55 points, extending their lead over second-placed Napoli, who visit third-placed Lazio later on Saturday, while Fiorentina stay sixth on 39 points.
Vucinic opened the scoring for an aggressive Juve side after 20 minutes, capitalising on Facundo Roncaglia's poor defensive header by smashing the ball home from just outside the area.
Matri doubled their lead four minutes before halftime after great work from Arturo Vidal, the midfielder evading four Fiorentina players before slipping in the striker.
Despite losing his right boot, Matri expertly slotted the ball past goalkeeper Emiliano Viviano to seal an easy win.
