Sierra Leone's Kamara relishing upcoming Man United clash
Norwich striker, who scored his first-ever Premier League goal last Saturday, says he's ready to take on Man United in upcoming English Premier League match
Norwich City striker Kei Kamara on Monday said he would "relish the challenge" of taking on English Premier League leaders Manchester United on Saturday.
The Sierra Leonean striker, who scored his first-ever Premier League goal last Saturday when Norwich defeated Everton 2-1, says he will play a role in his side's upcoming clash with Manchester United, given his previous experience against the Red Devils.
"We played against Man United when I was with Kansas on a pre-season tour in 2010," Kamara was quoted as saying by Sky Sports on Monday. "We were the only team in the states to beat them; I scored and helped with an assist in a 2-1 friendly win."
"Almost everyone was on the United team [at the time], including Paul Scholes, Ryan Giggs and Dimitar Berbatov," he added. "So I suppose I might be a marked man when we play against them next week."
"But that actually makes it a lot of fun for me," Kamara went on. "I'm used to being marked man in America; it just means I have to work that much harder."
He added: "It means you have to do different tricks to get past their defence and I really enjoy all that."
The 28-year-old striker also expressed his delight over scoring his maiden goal in the Premier League against Everton.
"It was a great moment in my life," he said. "I'm living the dream. It's not just scoring in a 4-1 defeat, it was an important goal and it's one that I'm going to remember forever."
