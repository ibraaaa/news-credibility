Russia, France share same objective on Syria: Hollande
France's president says Paris and Moscow have the same objective to avoid the disintegration of Syria and to avoid allowing 'terrorists' to profit from this chaos
France and Russia had the same objective in resolving the crisis in Syria although they differ on the means to achieve it, French President Francois Hollande said Thursday after talks with Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin.
"We have the same objective -- to avoid the disintegration of this country and to avoid allowing terrorists to profit from this chaos. We want political dialogue," Hollande declared alongside Putin after talks in the Kremlin. "There is the question of the manner of how to get there (to that objective) through political dialogue."
