Bombings kill 15 in Baghdad area
At least 15 are killed and 50 others injured in a series of bombings around the Iraqi capital Baghdad
Bombings in and around the Iraqi capital, including two car bombs near a football field, killed at least 15 people and wounded more than 50 on Thursday, security and medical officials said.
With the latest violence, more than 200 people have been killed and over 550 wounded in attacks in February, according to an AFP toll based on security and medical sources.
An interior ministry official said one car bomb exploded near a football field in the Shuala area of Baghdad, followed by a second after security forces arrived at the scene.
Police and a medical official said at least 11 people were killed and at least 30 wounded in the blasts.
In Mahmudiyah, south of Baghdad, a militant detonated a hand grenade when people attempted to arrest him, and five bombs exploded nearby, killing at least two people and wounding at least seven, security and medical officials said.
Two roadside bombs also exploded in the Shurta al-Rabea area of south Baghdad, killing one person and wounding seven, while a car bomb in Aziziyah, southeast of Baghdad, killed one person and wounded 17, officials said.
Violence in Iraq is down significantly from its peak in 2006 and 2007, but even 10 years after the 2003 US-led invasion of the country, attacks still occur almost every day.
