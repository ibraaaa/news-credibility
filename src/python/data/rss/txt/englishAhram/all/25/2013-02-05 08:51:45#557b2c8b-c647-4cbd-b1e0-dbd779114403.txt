Lebanon PM says ready to cooperate over Bulgaria attack
After Tuesday's accusation by Bulgaria over Hezbollah-linked members in the bombing of five Israeli nationals in July, Lebanon vows to cooperate in investigations over attack
Prime Minister Najib Mikati said on Tuesday Lebanon is ready to cooperate in investigations into a July bombing in Bulgaria that killed Israeli tourists, after Sofia blamed Hezbollah for the attack.
"Lebanon trusts that the Bulgarian authorities will undertake a serious evaluation of the results of the investigation and affirms that it is ready to cooperate with Bulgaria to shed light on the circumstances" of the attack, Mikati said in a statement.
The Bulgarian government said two people with Canadian and Australian passports linked to Lebanon's Shiite Hezbollah movement were behind the July 18 bombing of a bus that killed five Israeli tourists and a Bulgarian.
