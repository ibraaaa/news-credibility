Bulgaria says Hezbollah behind deadly anti-Israeli attack
Canadian and Australian nationals linked to Hezbollah are reportedly responsible for Bulgarian bomb attack in July which killed five Israeli tourists
The Bulgarian government said Tuesday that two people with Canadian and Australian passports linked to the Lebanese militia movement Hezbollah were behind a bomb attack in July that killed five Israeli tourists.
"We have information on financing and membership of Hezbollah for two people including the bomber," Interior Minister Tsvetan Tsvetanov told reporters.
"They had Canadian and Australian passports ... (and) lived in Lebanon since 2006 and 2010," he said.
The bombing on a bus carrying Israelis at Burgas Airport on Bulgaria's Black Sea coast, the deadliest attack on Israelis abroad since 2004, also killed the Bulgarian bus driver and the bomber. Some 30 people were wounded.
Israel immediately blamed Iran and its "terrorist proxy" Hezbollah but until now Bulgarian investigators have stopped short of blaming anyone for the 18 July attack.
