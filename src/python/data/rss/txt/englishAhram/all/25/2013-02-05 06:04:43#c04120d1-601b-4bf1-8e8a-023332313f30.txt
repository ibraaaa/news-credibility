Gedo, Fathi to boost Egypt in Chile friendly
Pharaohs hold final training session ahead of friendly against Chile in Madrid on Wednesday
Egypt have held their final training session in Madrid ahead of a friendly against Chile on Wednesday.
A number of foreign-based players have joined the squad, including midfielder Mohamed Abou-Trieka (Emirates, Bani Yas), Mohamed Salah (Swiss, Basel), Ahmed Said ‘Okka’ (Belgium, Lierse), Adam El-Abd (England, Brighton), Mohamed El-Neny (Basel), Ahmed Hassan 'Koka' (Portugal, Rio Ave FC).
Ahly duo Ahmed Fathi and Mohamed Nagy "Gedo," who completed their loan deal with Hull City this week, also joined Tuesday’s session.
Egypt, who delivered subpar performances in two successive friendly games last month against Ghana and Ivory Coast in the UAE, will host Zimbabwe in March in their third match in the World Cup qualifiers group stage.
The seven-time African champions top Group G with six points from two games, three ahead of second-placed Guinea. Zimbabwe and Mozambique hold one point each.
