"We're seeing strong purchasing power which is helping the market recover. The market also seems to be ignoring the deadly events in Tanta yesterday as well as worrying economic signs such as the drop in foreign reserves," said Ashraf Abdel Aziz, head of institutional sales at the Cairo-based brokerage Arabeya Online.
Angry protesters attacked the governorate security headquarters and the police station in Tanta on Monday, and clashes erupted between the protestors and security forces.
