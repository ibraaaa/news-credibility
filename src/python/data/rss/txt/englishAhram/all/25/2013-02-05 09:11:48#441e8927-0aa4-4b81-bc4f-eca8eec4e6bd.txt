Mohamed Barakat has recovered from flu and is available for Ahly’s Egyptian Premier League game against Wadi Degla on Sunday, the Cairo giants said on Tuesday.
The veteran attacking midfielder missed Ahly’s opening 1-0 victory over Ghazl El-Mahalla on Saturday.

The 36-year-old is expected to be an essential member of Ahly’s squad this term following the departure of influential duo Mohamed Nagy ‘Gedo’ and Mohamed Abou-Treika.
Gedo joined English second-division side Hull City and talismanic playmaker Abou-Treika moved to UAE club Bani Yas. Both players departed on loan deals.
Recent reports suggested that Barakat was reluctant to extend his current deal, which runs out at the end of the season, because he was told he would only play a bit-part role with the team.
Barakat has been one of Ahly’s most consistent performers since joining from Saudi Arabia’s Ahly Jeddah in 2004. He led the club to a host of domestic and continental titles.
