Zamalek’s Vieira unhappy despite win over Arab Contractors
Coach says Arab Contractors had the upper hand despite their 2-1 win
Zamalek's Brazilian manager Jorvan Vieira has expressed dissatisfaction with his team’s performance against Arab Contractors on Monday in the Egyptian Premier League, despite their 2-1 win.
“Players wasted many chances and our opponents dominated us, especially in the first half,” the 59-year-old coach was quoted as saying on the club’s official website.
Arab Contractors took the lead with a goal in the first half by Mohamed Farouk. Ahmed Samir equalised on 60 minutes and Mohamed Abdel-Shafi scored Zamalek's winner on 69 minutes.
“I am happy with the victory and I'm hoping Zamalek will have continued success,” said striker Ahmed Gaafar, who inspired a number of attacks.
The Cairo giants have 15 points from five matches, enjoying their best league start since 2003-2004.
“We haven’t won the title yet. We still have 11 matches,” Vieira added.
“It was a really hard game. Arab Contractors were better than us for most of the game,” the team’s skipper and goalkeeper Abdel-Wahed El-Sayed said. “I hope we win the domestic and the African titles this season.”
