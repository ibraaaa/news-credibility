Hanafi to speak on future of religious thought in Egypt Tuesday
Hassan Hanafi and Coptic thinker Samir Morqos will speak at SCC in Zamalek on Tuesday evening
Egypt’s Supreme Council for Culture (SCC) will host thinker and professor of Islamic philosophy Hassan Hanafi and writer Samir Morqos on Tuesday, 26 February, at 6pm to lecture on the future of religious thought in Egypt.
Hassan Hanafi is an emeritus professor of Islamic Philosophy at Cairo University. He has published more than 70 books and translated many masterpieces of western philosophy, and is a leading voice in the field of Islamic philosophy.
Hanafi's main concern is to reinterpret Islamic tradition including the Quran, the Sunna and other central Islamic texts. He argues that a renaissance in the Islamic world will only come about through a new reading of this heritage.
His opinions have often sparked controversy and sharp criticism from more conservative Islamic voices.
Samir Morqos is a Coptic thinker and writer, and has served in various public posts since the revolution, including as deputy for the Cairo governorate and as assistant to President Mohamed Morsi on matters of democratic transition. He resigned his role as presidential advisor in November 2012.
