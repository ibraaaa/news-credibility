Ultras Green Eagle storm governor-parties meeting in Port Said
Port Said's Ultras football fans storm into provincial building and interrupt meeting between the governor and members of political parties discussing curfew situation
Egypt's Ultras Green Eagle football team broke into Port Said's capitol building on Wednesday and forced everyone out, chanting for the fall of the Muslim Brotherhood.
The governor of Port Said was scheduled to meet at 3pm with members of various political parties to discuss the fate of the ongoing curfew imposed by President Mohamed Morsi on Sunday, but the storming action interrupted the meeting.
The Ultras group blamed the governor for ordering police to fire bullets at civilians during clashes last weekend and accused him of not representing the people of the city.
The nightly curfew is still in place in the restive province of Port Said from 9pm to 6am. Thousands of the city's residents have defied the curfew by organising nightly protests to break it.
A protest is planned in front of the provincial building at 8pm, in which members of the football fan group will announce a list of demands that the state must abide by.
The group threatens continual instability if Egypt officials do not heed their demands.
