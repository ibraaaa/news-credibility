Review: Enticed by the new ‘ Dishes Café ‘ in Zamalek?
Ahram Online gives you an idea of what to expect at Dishes Café in Zamalek and Maadi
Dishes Café opened another branch in Zamalek, with their Maadi branch already busy and doing relatively well near Samia Allouba Gym.
You will find that this is a typical café experience in Egypt with the best part of it being the location and ambiance.
Smart use of stone, wood and faux rattan, canvas umbrellas with wooden tubes makes you feel like you are in your own sophisticated patio. The ambiance is chill, low background music, TV screens play news and football matches, and add to that shisha (LE25). There are no non-smoking areas.
The waiters themselves boast their chicken strip appetizer (LE25), which are breaded with cornflakes, accompanied with a honey mustard sauce that doesn’t disappoint: it is a cut above the chicken strips you get at other cafes.
Their seafood soup is tomato-cream based, sprinkled with oregano and served luke warm PRICE.
Pasta? It’s nice to see variations, like 'rosie' sauce.
The beef fajitas, come out piping hot, frying in lots of oil on a skittle with bell peppers and onions, served with flour tortillas, guacamole with a hint of avocado and non-spicy pico de gallo. The dish misex a dash of salad with not overly-adorned meat.
The espresso was on the sweet, light side, cutting out most of the bitterness of the heavier coffees (LE16 for cappuccino).
