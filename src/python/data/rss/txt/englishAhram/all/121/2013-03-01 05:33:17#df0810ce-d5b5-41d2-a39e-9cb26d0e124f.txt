Egypt Journalists' Syndicate elections postponed
Lack of quorum at general assembly meeting forces postponement of Journalists' Syndicate leadership elections
Journalists' Syndicate leadership elections have been postponed after too few members attended a general assembly meeting on Friday.
At least 50 percent of around 3,000 general assembly members must be present for an election to take place, said the syndicate's deputy chairman, Gamal Fahmy.
Elections must be postponed by a fortnight if a quorum is not achieved.
Writer Abdel Mohsen Salama and political analyst Diaa Rashwan are standing for the post of syndicate leader.
