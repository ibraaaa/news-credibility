Tennis: Berdych beats Tursunov in semifinals in Marseille
Berdych reaches the final of the Open 13 after beating Tursunov of Russia in Marseille on Saturday
Top-seeded Tomas Berdych of the Czech Republic beat qualifier Dmitry Tursunov of Russia 6-2, 6-1 Saturday to reach the final of the Open 13.
Berdych will seek his first title of the season against the winner of the all-French semifinal pitting Jo-Wilfried Tsonga against Gilles Simon.
The 2010 Wimbledon runner-up didn't lose a single point in his service games in the first set, while breaking Tursunov twice to take control. Berdych saved the only two break points he faced at 4-0 in the second set, before clinching the victory with an ace.
Tursunov is a former top-20 player who has dropped to 119th in the rankings. He was playing in his first semifinal since June 2011.
Berdych helped lead the Czech Republic to the David Cup title last year.
