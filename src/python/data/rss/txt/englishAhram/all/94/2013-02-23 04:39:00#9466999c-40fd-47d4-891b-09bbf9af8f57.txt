President Morsi to change date of elections to avoid Coptic holidays
President Mohamed Morsi promises to change date of parliamentary elections as not to conflict with Coptic Christian holidays
President Mohamed Morsi announces that the date for the parliamentary elections will be changed to work around Coptic holidays.
Morsi made the statement Saturday during the first Egyptian Forum for Foreign Affairs.
The presidency initially announced on Thursday night that the post-constitution elections for the House of Representatives will commence 27-28 April, which coincides with Lazarus Saturday and Palm Sunday.
The runoffs were also scheduled during Holy Week and Easter, 4-5 May.
The choice of dates was
criticised
by many Copts, who perceived it as negligent and an attempt to marginalise the Christian community.
