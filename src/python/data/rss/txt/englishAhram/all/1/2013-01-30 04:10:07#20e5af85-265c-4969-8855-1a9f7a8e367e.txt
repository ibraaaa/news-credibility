Despite critical time, Zamalek coach Vieira still giving excuses for not showing up and the club haven’t started action against him
Zamalek Portuguese manager Jorvan Vieira told the White Castle he is coming back from UAE within a week after the club started searching for another coach.
“I will be coming within a week. No need to worry as I am just having an accommodation issues in Emirates,” Vieira was quoted as saying to Zamalek officials though phone on Ahram Sports Arabic website.
Amid financial crisis, the club threatened the 59-year-old who didn’t show up in Zamalek after a friendly in UAE, to take actions against him but it was never more than press statements.
Vieira, who took charge of the team last August on a two-season contract, sparked rumors of his possible departure of his post amid Egyptian football's uncertain future.
Zamalek have no time to prepare for the start of the Egyptian Premier League on 2 February, which has been frozen since last February because of the Port Said disaster.
However, security concerns remain, as a verdict is expected to be issued on the Port Said trial on Saturday, 26 January.
More than 70 Ahly fans were killed after they were confronted by the home Masry supporters following the end of an ill-tempered Egyptian Premier League game on 1 February 2012.
