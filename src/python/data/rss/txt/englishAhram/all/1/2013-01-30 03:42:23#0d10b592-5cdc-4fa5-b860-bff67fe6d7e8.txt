Emirati Bani Yas still flirting with Ahly star Abou-Treika
Bani Yas still show interest in Egypt key player Mohamed Abou-Treika hinting they are ready to splash the cash to land him
UAE outfitBani Yas has expressed their continued desire to land Ahly midfielder Mohamed ABou-Treika on loan after the Egyptian club hinted possible agreement.
“Bani Yas are studying the approval of Ahly. This time we will make a bigger offer,” the club’s chairman Mubarak bin Mohairoum was quoted as saying on Emirati newspaper Al-Bayan Wednesday.
Bani Yas have made a six-month loan offer for the 2012 best African-based footballer last month but he preferred to stay in the Cairo-based side extending his stay for two more years.
Ahly football director Sayed Abdel-Hafez reviled possible approval on loaning Treika especially as the Egyptian premier League new season, that is set to kick-off next week, is in jeopardy after current turbulence in the country following Port Said massacre verdict, one day after the 25 January revelation anniversary.
Egypt striker Mohamed Zidan, former Broussia Dortmund, Mainz and Hamburg striker, is currently playing in Bani Yas.
