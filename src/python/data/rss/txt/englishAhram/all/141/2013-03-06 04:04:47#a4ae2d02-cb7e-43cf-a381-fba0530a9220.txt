New forensic report shows El-Gendy died from torture
Forensic committee formed by Egyptian prosecutors shows that slain activist Mohamed El-Gendy died from torture, not from a car crash as ministry of interior claimed
A forensic committee stated on Wednesday that the death of activist Mohamed El-Gendy resulted from torture and not from a car accident, as a previous forensic report had asserted.
El-Gendy, 28, was a member of opposition group the Egyptian Popular Current.
He was arrested along with several protesters during anti-government rallies that took place on the second anniversary of the January 25 revolution.
Security sources later told Reuters that El-Gendy was taken to a state security camp where he was interrogated and tortured.
However, the interior ministry denied the accusations, saying that El-Gendy was hit by a car on 28 January and taken to Cairo’s Hilal Hospital where he died some days later.
On 12 February, a justice ministry forensic report was released that stated that El-Gendy’s death was due to a car crash and not to police torture.
The new forensic committee was formed on the orders of the Qasr El-Nil prosecution department and consisted of a number of prominent forensic doctors.
Amr Awad, director of the Qasr El-Nil branch of the prosecution, stated that the committee’s report indicated that El-Gendy’s body showed injuries consistent with beating and torture.
Awad said that El-Gendy's death was caused by serious bleeding in the brain, as a result of being hit on the head.
El-Gendy's death, together with other prominent cases such as that of Hamada Saber, who was beaten by security forces in an incident captured on camera, has reignited a debate in Egypt about the extent of police torture.
