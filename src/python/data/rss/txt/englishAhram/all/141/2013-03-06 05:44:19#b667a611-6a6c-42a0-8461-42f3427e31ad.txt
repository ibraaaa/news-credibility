Egypt court suspends parliamentary elections
Egypt's Administrative Court overturned a presidential decree calling parliamentary elections on 22 April, after referring Egyptian electoral legislation to the High Constitutional Court on Wednesday, questioning the constitutionality of the newly-drafted law.
On 18 February, the High Constitutional Court (HCC) rejected five articles in the recently drafted electoral law set to regulate the post-constitution parliamentary elections.
The law was referred back to the Shura Council (Egypt's upper house of parliament) for amendments, after which the legislative body partially amended the legislation without referring it back to the HCC.
President Mohamed Morsi then issued a decree declaring that parliamentary polls would be held in late April.
The Administrative Court ruled that the Shura Council, which is currently endowed with legislative authority, should have referred the law back to the HCC before ratifying it so as to ensure the constitutionality of the amendments.
