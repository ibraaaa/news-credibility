Orascom Telecom Holding ends year on steady footing
Orascom Telecom Holding rallies despite large loss in final quarter of 2012
Orascom Telecom Holding (OTH) registered a net loss of $474 million in the forth quarter of 2012.
Ahmed Abou Doma, chief executive officer, put the loss mainly down to OTH repaying a onetime non-cash loan to Globalive Canada. OTH has an indirect equity shareholding with the company.
He also said that the losses were compounded by tax charges and exchange losses highlighting that “operations achieved healthy growth in local currency terms but was adversely affected by the fluctuation of local currencies against the US dollar, mainly in Algeria and Pakistan.”
The company recorded a hike in mobile networks of 8.7 percent compared to the same period in 2011, reaching 84.9 million. There was a 0.4 percent loss from the third quarter of 2012 however.
The company’s revenues increased by 1.4 percent reaching $908 million. The earnings margin before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) rose to 46.8 percent, reflecting a solid performance for the company.
