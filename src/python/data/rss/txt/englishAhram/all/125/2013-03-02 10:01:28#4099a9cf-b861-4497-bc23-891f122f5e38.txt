Title holders Ahly to face Kenya’s Tusker in African Champions League
Tusker qualify for the African Champions League round of 32 to set up a clash against defending champions Ahly of Egypt
Egypt’s Ahly will kick off the defence of their African Champions League campaign against Kenyan side Tusker.
Tusker set up a clash against the seven-time African champions after crushing St Michel United of Seychelles 3-0 in the second leg of the preliminary round for a 7-1 aggregate victory.
Ahly, who won the prestigious title last year after overcoming Tunisia’s Eseprance in the final, were given a bye into the round of 32.
The Red Devils won the African Super Cup last month after beating AC Leopards of Congo 2-1 in Alexandria.
