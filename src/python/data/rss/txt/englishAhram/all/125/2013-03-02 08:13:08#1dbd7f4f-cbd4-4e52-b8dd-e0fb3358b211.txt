VIDEO: Egypt's Gedo scores twice as Hull crush Birmingham 5-2
The Egypt forward takes his tally with Hull City to five goals in six games as they crush Birmingham City 5-2 in the English Championship (second division)
Egypt forward Mohamed Nagy ‘Gedo’ continued his blistering goal-scoring run in the English second division after helping Hull City thrash Birmingham 5-2 on Saturday.
Gedo doubled Hull’s advantage after 11 minutes with a precise shot from inside the area and added the fifth with a powerful header 14 minutes from time after being set-up by compatriot Ahmed Elmohamady.
Right wing-back Elmohamady, who is enjoying a great run of form, also created Hull City’s third goal for George Boyd on 33 minutes.
Gedo, who is on loan from Egyptian champions Ahly, could have scored again on a couple of occasions, including a header that was tipped over by Birmingham keeper six minutes after the interval.
The 28-year-old had also found the net in Hull’s 2-1 win over Derby County, 1-0 victory over Charlton Athletic and the 2-0 win over Blackburn Rovers.
There was no room for Egypt’s Ahmed Fathi, who is also on loan from Ahly, in Hull’s squad for the Birmingham tie.
Hull are second in the championship table with 65 points, five behind leaders Cardiff City. The top two will earn direct promotion to the elite Premier League.
