Ahly's Soliman could play against Tusker in Champions League
Ahly's winger Walid Soliman could be fit to play against Kenyan side Tusker in the second leg of Champions League round of 32 on 7 April
Walid Soliman could make his first appearance since December when Ahly host Kneya's Tusker in the second leg of the African Champions League round of 32 on 7 April, team doctor Ihab Aly said on Tuesday.
The lively winger has been out of action since undergoing knee surgery last December, depriving Ahly of his pace and creativity.
"Walid Soliman will be able to join the team's training on the first of April," Ahly's doctor Aly told Ahram Sports on Tuesday.
The 28-year-old, who joined the Red Devils from ENPPI in the summer 2011, was instrumental in Ahly's triumphant campaign in the last edition of the Champions League, helping the club win a record-extending seventh title.
Ahly are favourites to reach the last 16 of Africa's premier club competition, having beaten Tusker 2-1 in Kenya in last week's first leg.
