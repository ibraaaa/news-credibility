Alexandria Book Fair opens on Wednesday
The fair, held at the Abdel Wahab Theatre in Azarita, will run from 20 February to 1 March
The fair will open on Wednesday under the title 'Alexandria ...Creativity and Revolution.'
 Minister of Culture Saber Arab and Alexandria Governor Abbas Atta will be at the opening.
Egypt's only international book fair is held in Cairo. The Cairo festival sees a good turnout from Egyptian and Arab publishers, in comparison to fairs based in other cities.
The Alexandrian fair aims to break the Cairo monopoly and meet the demands of readers outside the capital.
The new fair will include all GEBO's latest releases, as well as a cultural programme that will discuss poetry, novels and the challenges of publishing in Egypt.
