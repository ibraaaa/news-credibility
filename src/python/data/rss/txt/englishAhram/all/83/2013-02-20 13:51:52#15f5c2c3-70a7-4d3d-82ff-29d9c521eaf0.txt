Egypt's forward Gedo hungry for more goals in England
Coach Steve Bruce praises the Egypt striker's performance with Hull City
Gedo continued his blistering form with his third goal in four appearances, as Hull City defeated Blackburn Rovers 2-0 in the English Championship (second division) on Tuesday.
"We got another three marvellous points. All players performed well against Blackburn," Gedo said on his Twitter account after the match.
"I can't wait until I play against Bolton on Saturday," he added.
Gedo and his Ahly teammate Ahmed Fathi joined Hull City on a six-month loan deal during the January transfer window.
Hull City coach Steve Bruce was again full of praise for the Pharaohs star, but added that he still has a lot to deliver with the Tigers this season.
"We needed it," Bruce was quoted as saying by Sky Sports.
"We needed somebody to come. We all know what happened on deadline day. To get three in three, I know he'll hit a wall but, hopefully, with the sun shining (when) it gets into spring...he's a very, very good player.
"He uses that bit of class, he's got good ability and thankfully he's got three in three which is the icing on the cake for us," the coach added.
Hull lie second in the championship table with 62 points, five behind leaders Cardiff City who have a game to go. The top two will earn direct promotion to the elite Premier League.
