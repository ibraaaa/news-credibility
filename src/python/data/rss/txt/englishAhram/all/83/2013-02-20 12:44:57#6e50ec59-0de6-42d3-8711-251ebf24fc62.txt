One pregnant woman in Africa dies 'every minute'
A recent report claims that poor healthcare and other factors contribute to the death and injury of hundred of women in Sub-Saharan Africa every day
Mamaye, a multi-year campaign initiated by the British Department for International Development, unveiled the report on its website
The campaign estimated that those mothers who survive may still suffer. For every woman who dies during childbirth, it is estimated that another 30 are injured or become sick bringing life into the world.
Children are also at risk in Africa. Over a million newborns die each year; almost four every minute.
In sub-Saharan Africa, the lifetime risk of maternal death is 1 in 16, compared with 1 in 2,800 in developed countries.
The Mamaye campaign seeks to both educate and encourage communities to take collective and individual action for pregnant mothers via digital and mobile phone technology. The aim is to engage ordinary Africans in the fight to save mothers and babies.  
Mamaye anticipates that Africans will possess almost one billion mobile phones by 2016. In Ghana, for example, mobile penetration in the country has reached 80 percent of the country’s population.
One of the aims of the campaign is to strengthen the ability of African health systems to respond to the needs of pregnant women and their babies by improving access to and quality of essential and emergency care.
