New signings Fathi, Gedo included in Hull City’s trip to Brighton
The Egyptian pair will be tested during trainings and might make their debut against Brighton on Saturday
Just a couple of days after arriving in England, Ahmed Fathi and Mohamed "Gedo" Nagy are set to see action immediately, as they have been included in the Hull City team that will travel to take on Brighton in the Championship on Saturday.
The Egyptian pair, who signed a six-month loan deal with the Tigers coming from Egypt’s giants Ahly, were officially presented at the club on Thursday, as they were on international duty playing with the Pharaohs against Chile on Wednesday, a game that ended in a 2-1 defeat.
"They arrived with us on Thursday and we’ll take them down to Brighton with us," coach Steve Bruce told the club’s official website.
"They’re travelling with us, but they’re straight off a plane and it’s going to be a big ask of them (to play). We’ll have a training session with them tomorrow and see what sort of shape they’re in.
"We’ll see how they are and then we’ll make a decision," he concluded.
Fathi seems eager to start the challenge and feels he and his colleague are in a good shape.
"I played for Egypt against Chile on Wednesday night, although I have not played that many matches recently because of the trouble in Egypt.
"I don’t think the fitness will be a problem. I have been training well with Ahly and we’ve played in the African Champions League and World Club Cup recently," he was quoted as saying on the club’s website.
