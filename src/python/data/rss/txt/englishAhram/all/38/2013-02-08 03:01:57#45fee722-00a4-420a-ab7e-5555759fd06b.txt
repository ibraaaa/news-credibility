EgyptAir cancels Tunisia flights because of strike: Sources
Egypt's national carrier has reportedly cancelled two flights to Tunisia due to the general strike on Friday
Egypt's national airline cancelled flights to Tunisia on Friday after staff at Tunis airport joined a general strike, airport sources said.
Officials at Cairo airport said EgyptAir had told them it canceled two Friday flights. It was not immediately clear if other airlines were affected.
Tunisia faces a general strike Friday, with tens of thousands expected to take to the streets after the murder this week of a leftist opposition leader that sparked violent clashes with police.
The General Union of Tunisian Workers (UGTT) called the strike to coincide with the funeral of Chokri Belaid, a lawyer and vocal critic of the ruling Ennahda party who was shot dead outside his home Wednesday by a lone gunman.
