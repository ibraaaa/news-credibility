Egypt court rejects lawsuits against Constituent Assembly
High Constitutional Court dismisses lawsuits on composition of constitution-drafting body
The High Constitutional Court (HCC) has dismissed two lawsuits challenging the legality of Egypt's second Constituent Assembly which wrote the country's standing constitution.
The lawsuits challenged the criteria used to appoint members of the assembly by Egypt's lower house of parliament.
In June 2012, Egypt's High Constitutional Court dissolved the lower house of parliament because the law governing its elections was unconstitutional.
Egypt's Administrative Court referred the lawsuits to the HCC in October 2012.
The constitution was officially approved on 25 December 2012.
The first Constituent Assembly, which was also appointed by the lower house and was dominated by Islamists, was dissolved by an administrative court  in April 2012.
