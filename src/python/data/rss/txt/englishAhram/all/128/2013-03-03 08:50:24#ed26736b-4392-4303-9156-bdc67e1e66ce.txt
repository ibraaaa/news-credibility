Ahly coach denies departure rumours
Ahly's manager says all reports concerning his resignation are 'completely false'
Ahly's manager Hossam El-Badry said on Sunday he has no intention of leaving his post as Ahly's coach saying all reports which suggested his resignation are 'completely false'.
Several recent reports suggest that the 52-year-old coach has submitted his resignation to the club's management following Ahly's 3-0 heavy defeat to Harras El-Hodoud in the Egyptian league on Thursday.
This loss is the heaviest Egyptian league defeat for Ahly since 2007 when the African Champions lost to Ismaily 3-0 in Cairo.
The club's board denied all these reports in an official statement on Sunday and the coach confirmed that he will keep his post until the end of his contract.
"We put El-Hodoud's defeat behind us and we are fully concentrating on our upcoming engagements."
Ahly, who are third in the Egyptian League table, will have a tough mission next Sunday, when they meet second placed ENNPI in the Egyptian League group (A), before launching their campaign in the CAF Champions League against Kenyan side Tusker, one week later.
"The technical staff are capable of preparing the players to overcome their disappointment after El-Harass' loss," he concluded.
