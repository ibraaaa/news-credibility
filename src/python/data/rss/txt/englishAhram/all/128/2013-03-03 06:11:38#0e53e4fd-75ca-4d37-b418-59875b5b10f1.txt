The enemy realised its mistakes: Iran FM
Iranian FM Ali Akbar Salehi says the West will reduce nuclear-related sanctions as it concluded they are ineffective
Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Salehi has said international sanctions on Tehran will be gradually removed starting from 3 March.
"With the measures devised by the Iranian diplomatic apparatus, from today we will witness the gradual removal of sanctions," Salehi said on Sunday, Iran's Fars News Agency reported.
Salehi claimed the "enemy" had realised the ineffectiveness of sanctions.
"If the enemy has spent $100 to impose sanctions on Iran, it has not benefitted and reaped less than $10 in return," the minister said.
During talks in Kazakhstan, Iran and world powers agreed on Wednesday to hold new talks in March and April over the Islamic Republic's controversial nuclear programme.
According to AFP, there was no sign of a major breakthrough over Iran's nuclear ambitions in the Kazakh city of Almaty, but the agreement on new meetings suggests potential for progress.
The talks saw the five UN Security Council members and Germany offer Iran a softening of non-oil or financial sector-related sanctions in exchange for concessions over Tehran's sensitive uranium enrichment operations.
A senior US official said Iran "appeared to listen carefully to the offer" and its chief negotiator Saeed Jalili issued rare praise for the world powers' "positive" and "realistic" attitude.
Speaking in Vienna, Salehi went even further, saying he was "very optimistic about the outcome."
"Things are taking a turning point and I think the Almaty meeting will be (seen as) a milestone."
Uranium enrichment is the most sensitive part of the nuclear cycle as the process can be used to make both nuclear fuel and the explosive core of a nuclear bomb that Western powers fear Iran wants to develop.
