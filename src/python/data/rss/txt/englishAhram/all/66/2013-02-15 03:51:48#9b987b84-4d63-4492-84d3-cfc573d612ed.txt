AS Roma's Pablo Osvaldo and Daniele De Rossi could miss Saturday's Serie A home game against leaders Juventus because of injuries
Italy striker Osvaldo, who has been at the centre of a penalty controversy after stealing a spot kick from Francesco Totti and missing it during their 3-1 defeat at Sampdoria last Sunday, missed training on Friday with a right knee injury, Sky Sport 24 reported.
Midfielder De Rossi is suffering from a knock to his left thigh and is undergoing a special training schedule to get him ready for the clash.
