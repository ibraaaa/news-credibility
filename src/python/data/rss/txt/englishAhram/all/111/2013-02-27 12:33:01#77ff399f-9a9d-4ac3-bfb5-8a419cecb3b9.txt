Raya is one of a number of Salafist parties to emerge in Egypt since the January 25 Revolution, including the Salafist Call's Nour Party, the Salafist Front’s People's Party, and the Watan Party.
The Watan Party,
recently established
by ex-members of the Nour Party and lead by its former chairman Emad Abdel-Ghafour, has said it will form an electoral alliance with Abu-Ismail’s party in the parliamentary election.
The Nour Party, which won around 23 percent of the seats in the 2012 parliamentary election, has said it is not holding talks with any party about an electoral alliance at this time, but has said explicitly it will not ally with the Muslim Brotherhood as it did in the last parliamentary poll.
