VIDEO: 6 April protest police violence in Mansoura with mock coffin
Police in Mansoura are accused of killing one protester by running him over
The 6 April Youth Movement staged a brief protest against police violence at the security directorate of Mansoura, the Delta city capital of Egypt's Daqahliya province, shown in a video uploaded by the group to social networks on Sunday.
 
The city has become the scene of daily clashes between anti-government protesters and security forces since activists started campaigning for a civil disobedience campaign last week.
Allegations of police brutality include the case of 29-year-old resident Hossam Abdel Azim who was, according to eyewitnesses, killed by being run over by a police vehicle.
Members of 6 April, a pro-revolution political group, chanted against police violence and placed a mock casket at the entrance of the directorate, with the words "here lie your victims" written on it.
