US Embassy denies Kerry's flight delayed by Ultras Ahlawy protest
US Secretary of State's flight following his two-day visit to Cairo was delayed as a result of extended meeting with President Morsi, US Embassy in Cairo claims
The US Embassy in Cairo has denied reports that US Secretary of State John Kerry's recent departure from Cairo was delayed as a result of a protest by a group of Ahly football club fans, the Ultras Ahlawy.
On Sunday evening, Ahram Online published a news piece stating that Kerry's departure had been delayed for two hours because the Ultras had blocked the road leading to the Cairo International Airport.
In a statement, the embassy said that the protests by Ahly fans had not had an impact on Kerry's departure, which was delayed as a result of a prolonged meeting with President Mohamed Morsi.
While in Egypt, Kerry met with Morsi, head of Egyptian general intelligence Refaat Shehata, and defence minister Colonel General Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi.
Before leaving Cairo, Kerry issued a statement urging Egyptians to brace for "hard work and compromises" with a view to "restoring stability and the Egyptian economy."
