Ahly fans besiege central bank in Alexandria
The Ultras blockaded the Alexandrian branch of the Central Bank of Egypt on Monday morning, demanding harsh sentences in Port Said case
Dozens of hardcore Ahly football fans, known as the Ultras Ahlawy, surrounded the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) offices in Alexandria governorate on Monday in a yet another show of strength before a much-anticipated trial verdict on 9 March.
The supporters are demanding harsh sentences for interior ministry and Masry football club officials for their alleged roles in last year's Port Said disaster, when over 70 Ahly fans were killed in post-match violence after an away game against Port Said team Masry.
On Sunday, the Ultras group surrounded the CBE's main headquarters in Cairo and cut off the road leading to the airport. US Secretary of State John Kerry, who was in Cairo on Sunday evening, saw his departure from the country delayed two hours due to the events.
