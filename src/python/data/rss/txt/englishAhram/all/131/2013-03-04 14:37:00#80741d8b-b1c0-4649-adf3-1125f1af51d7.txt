VIDEO: Cameroon striker Boya on Egypt’s Ahly radar
Former Rangers forward Boya will be on trial with Ahly soon: Football director
Egyptian champions Ahly have confirmed their interest on Cameroon forward Pierre Boya.
“Boya will soon attend trials and we will then decide about him," the Red Devils football director Sayed Abdel-Hafiz told South African SuperSport Monday.
"His agent offered him to us and we watched some video clips but the head coach wants to see him in action and then there is the medical test which he must pass too," he added.
Boya was released by Scotland’s Rangers FC last week.
"He is free and that will make it easy to sign with him, hope he comes and we will see what will happen."
The 29-year-old attacker, who started his career in Lebanon’s Salam Zgharta, played in Partizan of Serbia, Rapid Bucuresti of Romania and Grenoble of France.
