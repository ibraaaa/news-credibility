Italy court orders retrial in Knox sex-murder case: media
Amanda Knox and former boyfriend to face retrial after acquittal in 2011, in case concerning the killing of British roommate six years ago
 
Italy's highest court of appeal overturned the acquittal of US student Amanda Knox on Tuesday and ordered a retrial over the murder of her British roommate, according to media reports.
Knox and her Italian former boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito—originally sentenced to 26 and 25 years in prison for killing and sexually assaulting Meredith Kercher in 2007—were acquitted on appeal in 2011 after four years in prison. Both now face a retrial.
This case which garnered significant media attention during the past years, began in 2007 after Knox moved to Perugia, northern Rome, for one year and shared a room with Kercher. In November 2007, Kercher's semi-naked body was found at her home with her throat cut. Both Knox and her boyfriend Sollecito were arrested at the time for the murder.
