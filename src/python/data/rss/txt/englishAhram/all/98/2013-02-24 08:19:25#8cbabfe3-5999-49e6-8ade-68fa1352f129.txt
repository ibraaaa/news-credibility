Ivory Coast's Yaya Toure wants to end his career at Man City
The Ivorian midfielder reveals his desire to stay at Manchester City until the end of his career
Manchester City's Ivorian midfielder Yaya Toure said on Sunday he would be happy to end his career at the English Premier League club after proving a revelation in Roberto Mancini's squad.
The 29-year -old, who joined City in the summer of 2010 from Spanish giants Barcelona, has two years remaining on his contract with the Citizens but he insisted he has no desire to leave the club.
"I want to give all to this club for a long time. It's quite strange because all my career I've been with clubs for two or three years," he told The Sun on Sunday.
"Normally I change clubs after one or two years but it's different here. I want to stay longer.
"Sometimes you're not happy with something or you don't feel comfortable in the city and you need change, but not here.
"Of course I'd like to end my career here. For three years it has been enjoyable to be with guys who love you, guys who care about you." He added.
Toure, who was voted as the best African player in 2011 and 2012, admits it was tough for him to leave his club fighting in the Premier League to represent his country in the last Africa Cup of Nations.
"When your friends need you and you are away it's always harder," he added.
"You want to be with them. It's always difficult. I'm African and the tournament makes us leave for one month.
"Your club have to play hard games. Sometimes I feel sad.
"When I was away we didn't get the right results and January is always hard because we have to play every three days. But it's part of football. We can do nothing about it."
