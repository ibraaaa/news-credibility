New release: Demographics expert analyses Egyptian voting
Akram Alfy relies on political demography analysis to predict voting in upcoming parliamentary elections
by Akram Alfy, Cairo: Al-Ahram Center for Political and Strategic Studies, 2013.
The new book by researcher Akram Alfy looks into Egyptians' voting power via a demographic analysis of the society. Alfy, whose thesis on political demography of the Hebrew state, draws the demographic map of Egypt and analyses two trends: the population's large and growing youth component and the increasing exodus from the villages to the cities.
Alfy refutes the argument that Islamists are bound to continue winning any elections in Egypt, reasoning that Egypt is divided into two blocks: one that is in full support of Islamist currents and a second that leans towards the secular current. The latter is mainly composed of urban residents, the middle class, the richer segments of the villages and where religious tension is lowest.
Akram Alfy concludes that the secular current is likely to increase its share in votes up to 40 percent, while the Islamists will likely exceed 45 percent, with the remaining undecided voters continuing to linger between stability and the need for change.
