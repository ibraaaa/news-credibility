Ahly refusal threatens Egypt-Qatar friendly
Egyptian Football Association set to miss out on LE1 million if friendly match with Qatar is cancelled due to refusal of Ahly to release their players
Egypt's friendly against Qatar on 7 March is threatened with cancellation because Ahly are yet to give permission for their players to take part in the non-FIFA approved match.
“Bradley has said he will not play the Qatar game unless all players he called up join the squad,” Al-Ahram daily newspaper reported on Sunday.
This condition threatens the game that would earn the Egyptian Football Association LE1 million.
Leading Group A of the Egyptian Premier League, Ahly, under coach Hossam El-Badry, refused to permit their international players to join the Pharaohs camp for the Qatar friendly as they “have crucial league clashes.”
The coaching staff of the seven-time Africa Cup of Nations champions, who are finalising their preparation for the 2014 World Cup qualifier against Zimbabwe on 22 March, refused to comment on Ahly's decision.
Al-Ahram said, “A month ago, Bradley accepted the absence of Ahly players who stayed with their team to take part on a friendly in Saudi Arabia and that cost the Pharaohs a loss against Ghana."
