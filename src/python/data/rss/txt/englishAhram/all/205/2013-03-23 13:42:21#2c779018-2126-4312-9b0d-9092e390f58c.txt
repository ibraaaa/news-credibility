Sons of Egyptian Salafist Saber to be detained 4 more days
Gamal Saber's brother is out on bail; meanwhile sons will remain in detention for 4 days facing charges of attempted murder and arms possession in Shubra events
North Cairo prosecution orders a four-day detention of the two sons of prominent Salafist Gamal Saber. Saber's brother has been released on LE1000 bail ($145).
The lot were arrested last week during deadly clashes in the Shubra district of Cairo last week.
Saber's sons, Ahmed and Abdel-Rahman, are facing charges of attempted murder, possession of weapons, resisting authorities and thuggery.
The two young men denied all charges and alleged they were only watching the fight from afar. Saber's brother denied being present during the fight.
Gamal Saber is the coordinator of Lazem Hazem (It Must be Hazem), a group supporting former Salafist presidential candidate Hazem Salah Abu-Ismail.
Saber, together with his two sons and brother, are accused of involvement in clashes that broke out Monday after Saad Dorra (15) was killed during a football match at a school in Shubra, reportedly by Saber's son.
The fight left three people dead and dozens injured.
According to a security source more than 11 suspects have been detained so far for involvement in the incident.
