Pope arrives for historic talks with predecessor Benedict XVI
Pope Francis flew in for an unprecedented encounter with his predecessor Benedict XVI at the papal residence of Castel Gandolfo near Rome -- a first in Catholic Church history. The pope's helicopter was seen landing near the picturesque hilltop palace, an AFP reporter saw. The Vatican said Benedict was waiting for him at the heliport and the two will have lunch.
