Ghana has 50-50 chance of World Cup qualification, says former star
Black Cats' chances of qualifying for World Cup were damaged by defeat to Zambia, says former Ghana international Joe Addo
Ex-Ghana star Joe Addo has said he is pessimistic about the Black Stars' chances of reaching the World Cup in Brazil in 2014.
Ghana will face Sudan at the Baba Yara Stadium in Kumasi in a must-win game on 24 March.
The Black Stars are second in the group table with 3 points, one behind leaders Sudan.
Ghana smashed the group's bottom team Lesotho 7-0 and lost their second game to Zambia.
“Our chances are 50-50. We had our problems when we lost in Zambia. That’s where our problems started,” Addo was quoted as saying on Ghanasoccernet.
“If we had drawn there, I think things would have been okay. When the points went to the Zambians it made it extremely difficult for us," he added.
“I think we’ll be able to beat Sudan home and away and then beat Zambia here. I am very sure we can do it.
“But it’s not an easy task. It’s a very difficult and tall ordeal for the national team and the technical staff so I hope they get it right.
“It’s not easy at all trying to win every single game to qualify for the World Cup. And you have to understand that even when we get out of this group, it’s not a guarantee that we’re going to the World Cup. Now we have to go and play the play-offs.
“So it’s a very tall order this time around. It wasn’t like six years or eight years ago. It’s a very different scene altogether.
“It will be heartbreaking for us not to make the next World Cup so I’m really hoping that we’re able to do it,” the former Ghana star concluded.
Ghana, who finished fourth at the 2013 African Cup of Nations, are seeking to book a place at their third successive World Cup.
