Pope Francis vows 'renewed collaboration' with Jews
`Pope Francis promised "renewed collaboration" with Jews in a letter to Rome's chief rabbi on Thursday -- his first full day as leader of the world's Catholics.
"I sincerely hope I can contribute to the progress there has been in relations between Jews and Catholics since the Second Vatican Council in a spirit of renewed collaboration," the pope said, referring to a landmark council from the 1960s.
