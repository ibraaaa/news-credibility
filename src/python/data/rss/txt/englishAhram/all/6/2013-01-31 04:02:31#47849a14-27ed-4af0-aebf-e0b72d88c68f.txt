Ahly loan defender 'Taha' to Wadi Degla
Ahly agrees on loaning young defender Mohamed Abdel-Fattah 'Taha' to Egypt's Wadi-Degla, two days before the scheduled Premier League kick-off
Cairo giants Ahly have finalized a six-month loan deal for defender Mohamed Abdel-Fattah ‘Taha’ to Wadi Degla.
“The club ended the paperwork to loan ‘Taha’ to Wadi Degla for six months. He is to start his regular training with the team by tomorrow,” reads a statement published on the Cairo giants’ official website.
Midfielder Mohamed Abou-Treika is approved to join UAE's Bani Yas, while duo Ahmed Fathi and Mohamed Nagy ‘Gedo’ are ending travel procedures to play for English Championship side Hull City on a six-month loan.
Amid financial crisis for almost all Egyptian clubs, the domestic Premier League new season is due to start on 2 February after a one year suspension following the Port Said stadium disaster that left more than 70 Ahly fans dead and hundreds injured. The league resumption is still uncertain because of ongoing unrest in the country.
Ahly is scheduled to kick-off their title race on Saturday against Ghazl El-Mahalla.
