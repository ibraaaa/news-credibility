Zamalek suffer key injuries ahead of league start
Defender Mahmoud Fathallah suffers knee injury and undergoes medical tests before Zamalek's league opener on Saturday
Egypt and Zamalek defender Mahmoud Fathallah is a major doubt for the start of the Egyptian Premier League season on Saturday due to a knee injury that sidelined him from Thursday's training session.
"Fathallah has a knee injury and he will undergo medical tests," read a statement on the club's official website on Thursday.
The league has been postponed since February 2012, when 71 Ahly fans were killed and hundreds injured at a match in the Port Said stadium.
Winger Ahmed Samir continued his rehab for a muscle injury, while midfielder Ahmed Fathi is out of the league opener with muscle problems.
The Whites are scheduled to face Ittihad of Alexandria in the Cairo Stadium on Saturday.
The Egyptian Football Association (EFA) announced the league, which has 18 teams, will be played in two groups for the fifth time in the competition’s 65-year history.
Zamalek were paired in Group B alongside Ismaily, Dakhleya, Ittihad of Alexandria, El-Entag El-Harby, Ittihad Al-Shorta, Petrojet, Talae El-Geish and Arab Contractors.
Ahly, who won the league’s last edition in 2011, were drawn in Group A along with ENPPI, Harras El-Hodoud, Ghazl El-Mahalla, Beni Suef Telephones, Wadi Degla, Maqassa, Smouha and Gouna.
