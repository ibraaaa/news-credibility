Mubarak-era minister Youssef Wali freed on appeal
Court overturns conviction for squandering public funds of former agriculture minister Youssef Wali
Former agriculture minister Youssef Wali has had his conviction for squandering public funds overturned.
In March 2012, Wali and former prime minister Atef Ebeid were sentenced to ten years in jail for squandering more than LE700 million of public funds in the sale of the Al-Bayadeyah Island nature reserve in Luxor.
Wali served as minister of agriculture from 1982 until 2004. He also served as deputy prime minister and deputy chairman of Hosni Mubarak's now-dissolved National Democratic Party.
