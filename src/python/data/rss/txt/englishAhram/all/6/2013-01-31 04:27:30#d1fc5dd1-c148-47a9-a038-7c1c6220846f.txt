Egyptian pound falls at 16th currency auction
Local currency slides to LE6.682 against the US dollar at central bank auction on Thursday
The Egyptian central bank offered $50 million to banks at its 16th foreign currency auction on Thursday.
The cut-off price at the auction was LE6.682, down from LE6.6525 on Tuesday. The auction saw $48.7 million sold to local banks, which was less than the $50 million it had initially offered.
The auctions are part of a shift in currency policy announced in late December and designed to save the country's foreign reserves, which have fallen to a critical level. The bank decided two weeks ago to holding three auctions per week, instead of daily sales.
