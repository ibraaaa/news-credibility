Real Madrid coach lauds players for Barcelona draw
Following 1-1 draw with Barcelona in Spain Cup semifinals on Wednesday, Real Madrid assistant coach Aitor Karanka calls his team's performance 'amazing'
Real Madrid assistant coach Aitor Karanka praised the performance of his players after a 1-1 draw with Barcelona in Spain Cup semifinals on Wednesday.
"The team were really good. Everyone did an amazing job, especially with the absences that we're suffering, with players out of position. We're very happy with the team's performance," Karanka was quoted as saying on the club's official website.
Karanka also praised the performance of French centre-back Raphael Varane, who scored the equaliser for Real Madrid in the first leg of the Spain Cup semifinal against Barcelona.
"For Varane, the match will serve him phenomenally well in his progress. He has a good head on his shoulders and will keep improving," the 39-year-old assistant coach said.
Karanka believes the two sides – Real Madrid and Barcelona – both did their best throughout the game, leaving the cup up for grabs.
"Now we have to rest and think about Granada," he said. "It's a long time until the second leg and there will be time to prepare."
Nineteen-year-old Real Madrid defender Varane, for his part, expressed his pleasure after scoring the equaliser.
"I'm very happy with how I played," he said.
"It was incredible; to score a goal is a dream," he added. "I still can't believe it. It's the best match I've played for Real Madrid"
