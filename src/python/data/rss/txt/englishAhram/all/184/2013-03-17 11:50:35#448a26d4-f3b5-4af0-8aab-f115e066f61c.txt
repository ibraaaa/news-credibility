Egypt need fan support against Zimbabwe, says Elmohamady
The Pharaohs star hopes that "30,000 supporters" will turn up for upcoming World Cup qualifier against Zimbabwe in Alexandria
Egypt's right wing-back Ahmed Elmohamady urged Egyptian fans to flock to Alexandria's Borg El-Arab Stadium and cheer on the Pharaohs during the upcoming World Cup qualifier against Zimbabwe on 26 March.
According to local reports, the interior ministry has agreed to allow up to 30,000 fans to attend the match despite security concerns in the country.
Elmohamady, who is playing at English second-division side Hull City on loan from Sunderland, was called up for the match alongside other 11 foreign-based players.
"We are about to make the dream come true and we just ask for the support of the fans in the next game as we used to play outside the country or on our soil in empty stands,'' the 25-year-old player told his official website.
Egypt top Group G in the qualifiers with six points from two games, three ahead of second-placed Guinea. Zimbabwe and Mozambique have one point each.
American coach Bob Bradley has vowed to secure Egypt their first ticket to the most prestigious global competition since 1990, despite the team's poor run in friendly games that saw them lose 3-0 to Ghana, 4-2 to Ivory Coast, 2-1 to Chile and 3-1 to Qatar.
''Bob is doing good job here and he is working on his objective and we have to back him because his success is ours," said Elmohamady.
''Egypt deserve some good news and we as players are doing our best to make the people happy.''
''I hope to see more than 30,000 spectators in the stadium next match," he concluded.
Elmohamady has recently delivered some impressive performances with Hull City at the English Championship. He is lauded for his darting runs down the right flank and pinpoint crosses.
