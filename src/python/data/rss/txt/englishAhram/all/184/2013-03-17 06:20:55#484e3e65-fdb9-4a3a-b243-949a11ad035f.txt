Libyan ambassador promises investigation into Coptic church attack
Top Libyan diplomat in Cairo says the embassy will reopen soon after a meeting with Coptic pope
"The Libyan Embassy suspended its work in Cairo as a precautionary measure, and to ensure the safety of its citizens," said Ashour Hamid bin Rashid, the Libyan ambassador in Cairo on Sunday.
The embassy temporarily suspended its services on Saturday in response to protests at the premises by Egyptian Coptic activist groups, angry at reports of mistreatment of Copts in Libya.
Following a meeting with Coptic Orthodox Patriarch Tawadros II on Sunday afternoon, Rashid announced at a press conference that the embassy will resume its work.
The Libyan ambassador stressed the importance of the safety of all Egyptians in Libyan territory.
Rashid described the burning of a Coptic Orthodox Church in Benghazi last Thursday as a criminal act, and promised that an investigation would be put in place to bring the perpetrators to justice.
