Zamalek keeper El-Sayed out of Talae El-Gaish league game
Zamalek's skipper Abdel-Wahed El-Sayed to miss Tuesday's league match against Talae El-Gaish as to link up with Egypt ahead of a World Cup qualifier
Zamalek goalkeeper Abdel-Wahed El-Sayed has been left out of Zamalek's squad for an Egyptian Premier League game upon his request as he sought to rest before Egypt face Zimbabwe in a World Cup qualifier later this month.
The experienced goalkeeper will now sit out Zamalek's upcoming league game against Talae El-Gaish on Tuesday.
The 35-year-old was recalled to the Pharaohs roster for the Zimbabwe clash after coach Bob Bradley snubbed veteran guardian Essam El-Hadary.
El-Sayed is likely to stand between the sticks against Zimbabwe. Ahmed El-Shenawy, who has just recovered from  a serious knee injury, will deputize for him in Zamalek's league game.
The Cairo giants will be looking to maintain their perfect start to the season, having bagged maximum 18 points from six games to top Group B with 18 points.
Goalkeepers:
 Ahmed El-Shennawy, Mahmoud Abdel-Rehim

 Mahmoud Fathallah, Omar Gaber, Mohamed Abdel-Shafy, Salah Soliman, Sabry Rahil, Ahmed Samir, Ahmed Magdy.
