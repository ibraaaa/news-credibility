Italy's Eni makes new oil discovery in Egypt
Italy's Eni said on Wednesday it had made a new oil discovery in the western desert of Egypt as the oil and gas major moves to consolidate its presence in the country.
Eni, the biggest foreign energy player in Egypt, said in a statement the new discovery was from the NFW well "Rosa North 1X" located in the Meleiha Concession.
Two wells will be drilled in 2013 and production from each is estimated at 2,000 barrels of oil per day, Eni said.
The discovery follows the Emry Deep field find in 2012 which is currently producing 18,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day after 7 months.
Eni, the biggest foreign oil and gas operator in Africa, owns 56 per cent of the Meleiha Concession through its affiliate IEOC.
In 2011 Eni's oil and gas equity production in Egypt averaged about 240,000 boe/d.
