Lamouchi to remain as Ivory Coast coach despite elimination
Ivory Coast's coach Sabri Lamouchi will continue in his post despite their surprising elimination from the Nations Cup quarters
Ivory Coast football association's president Sidy Diallo confirmed on Wednesday that Sabri Lamouchi will retain his post as the national team's coach despite their failure to win the elusive Africa Cup of Nations title.
Ivory Coast's adventure in the tournament ended on Sunday after their 2-1 loss to Nigeria in the quarter-finals.
"Players and members of Ivory Coast's FA are aware of Lamouchi's great efforts with the team. He will remain with the Elephants," Diallo told 
Ivorian newspaper Faternité Matin on Wednesday.   
"Sacking the coach after defeats is not a wise decision."
Diallo also said the Ivorians should put their Nations Cup's failure behind them and focus on the 2014 World Cup qualifiers.
Ivory Coast, who are leading Group C of the World Cup qualifiers with four points from two matches, will meet Gambia in their nest game in March.
"Our target is to reach 2014 World Cup," concluded Diallo.
