FIFA president Blatter critical of UEFA's Platini's 2020 Euro plans
Sepp Blatter slams Michael Platini over plans for 2020 European Championship
FIFA President Sepp Blatter has criticized plans for the 2020 European Championship to be played in 13 countries, saying the tournament will lack ''heart and soul.''
Blatter's comments in Germany's Kicker magazine are seen as a dig at UEFA President Michael Platini, who could be Blatter's rival for the FIFA presidency in 2015.
Blatter did not rule out running again in 2015, although he says he is also ready to turn over the reins to someone else.
A European Championship spread around the continent was an idea proposed by Platini, who is also a FIFA vice president.
