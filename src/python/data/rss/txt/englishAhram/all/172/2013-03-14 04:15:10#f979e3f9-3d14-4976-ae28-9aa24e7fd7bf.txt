Ahly striker Hamdy doubtful for defending African title kick-off
Flu may add Ahly striker El-Sayed Hamdy to the long list of missing key players against Tusker in the Africa Champions League kickoff
"Hamdy is suffering from 'flu at the team's camp in Kenya," read a statement published on the club's official website.
"He trained individually Thursday under the supervision of Ahly physician Ehab Ali, in an attempt to rehabilitate him."
The Cairo giants are on a tough mission to defend their African title due to a number of injured players including Sayed Moawad, Walid Soliman and Hossam Ghaly, or for loaned players like Bani Yas's Mohamed Abou-Treika and Hull City duo Ahmed Fathi and Mohamed 'Gedo' Nagi.
The absence of key players obviously influenced the Egyptian champions in their domestic league race as they lost twice, 0-1 to Smouha and 0-3 to Haras El-Hodoud, gaining 12 points from six matches.
Ahly's bitter rivals Zamalek are playing Friday against DR Congo's AS Vita Club in the same round in Borg El-Arab stadium in Alexandria behind closed doors, while their fans protest demanding attendance.
