Egypt's Fathi will fight for first-team spot at Hull, denies departure
Ahmed Fathi says he will continue to compete for regular starting spot at English Championship team Hull City
Egypt and Hull City midfielder Ahmed Fathi, who has played just a few games for the English Championship side since he joined in January, has revealed he will remain patient and fight for a first team place.
"I'm training very well, and I'm not angry about my lack of playing time," Fathi was quoted as saying on the
Hull Daily Mail
website on Thursday.
"There was an offer for me from another team in the Championship, but Steve Bruce rejected it," he added.
The former Ahly midfielder has made just three fleeting appearances off the bench while his teammate Mohamed Nagy 'Gedo' has become an instant hit after bagging five goals in eight appearances.
"[Coach] Bruce told me not to rush and promised me a bigger role in future matches," Fathi concluded.
The 28-year-old joined Hull City on a six-month loan deal during the January transfer window alongside fellow countryman Mohamed Nagi 'Gedo'.
The Tigers are bidding to book a place in the English Premier League. They are second in the second tier with 68 points.
