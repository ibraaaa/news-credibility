Hossam Hassan boosts Maqassa by landing ex-Ahly Afroto
Mostafa Selim joins Maqassa in a free transfer to back manager Hossam Hassan in his Premier League bid
The former Egypt youth player was released by his boyhood club Ahly to the Azerbaijani team in winter 2012. He was loaned twice to Alexandrian clubs; Smouha S.C. in 2008 and Al-Ittihad in 2011.
"I reached an agreement with Maqassa officials last year but the Port Said disaster postponed the move," Afroto told Egyptian satellite channel Modern Sports Thursday.
The 23-year-old left the Red Castle after the Port Said stadium disaster, which left 72 Ahly fans dead after clashing with rivals Masry following a league game.
Ahly were led by Portuguese manager Manuel Jose, who wasn't fully convinced of Afroto's abilities, while Masry was led by current Maqassa manager Hossam Hassan.
Afroto regularly complained to the media about not being given enough chances.
Hassan, who joined Maqassa in late February, is bidding for a spot in the second round of the Egyptian Premier League, being fifth in Group A with 8 points from 6 games.
"I am so glad that my new team are led by the successful twin [Hassam and football director Ibrahim]. I have admired their football abilities since I was a little child and I am hoping that they can reintroduce Afroto to the fans," concluded Afroto.
