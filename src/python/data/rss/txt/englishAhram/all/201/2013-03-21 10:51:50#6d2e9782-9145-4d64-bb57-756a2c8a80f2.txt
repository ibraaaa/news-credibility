FIFA rejects Zamalek's transfer request for Shikabala
Star forward won't be able to play with Zamalek this season after FIFA declines team's request to register player with squad after closure of winter transfer window
 
FIFA has rejected Zamalek's request to register winger Mahmoud Abdel-Razek 'Shikabala' with their squad for the rest of the season, Ahram Sports reported on Thursday.
The 27-year-old forward signed a one-year loan deal with UAE side Al-Wasl last summer, but the Gulf team ended his spell amicably on 9 February after the closure of the winter transfer window.
The Cairo giants had asked FIFA for an exception to allow them to register the player with their squad based on Article 6 of FIFA regulations.
The article states: "Associations are authorised to register such professionals provided due consideration is given to the sporting integrity of the relevant competition. Where a contract has been terminated with just cause, FIFA may take provisional measures in order to avoid abuse."
But the world football body turned down Zamalek's request, since the player had terminated his contract with Al-Wasl after the closure of the winter transfer window.
Abdel-Razek now has few options, as he can only join leagues in which the transfer window remains open.
Shikabala has two years remaining on his contract with Zamalek, which is set to expire in the summer of 2015.
