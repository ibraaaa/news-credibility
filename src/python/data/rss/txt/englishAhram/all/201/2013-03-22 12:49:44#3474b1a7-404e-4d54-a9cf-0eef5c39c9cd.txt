Nigerian commits suicide at Cairo airport
A Nigerian man committed suicide at the Cairo International Airport early Friday morning.
The man, identified as Nev Orkuma, jumped from the top of the airport arrival hall building.
Airport security sent ambulances, but the man died soon after hitting the parking lot grounds facing the airport building.
Preliminary investigations by Egyptian police suggest the man was intending to travel to Abuja but was facing financial troubles and asked several travellers for loans to purchase a ticket, reports Al-Ahram Arabic news site.
