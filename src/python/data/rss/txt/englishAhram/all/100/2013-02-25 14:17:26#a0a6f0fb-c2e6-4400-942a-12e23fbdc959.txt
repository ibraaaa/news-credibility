Muscle injury sidelines Egypt's Abou-Treika for a week
The Bani Yas forward will be out of action for a week because of a muscle injury
UAE's Bani Yas traveled to Saudi Arabia to face Al-Faisaly in the Gulf Club Championship on Tuesday without the Ahly star, who joined the team last January.  
"Bani Yas technical staff decided to keep Abou-Treika out of the team squad that will face Al-Faisaly in the Gulf Club Championship due to muscle injury," Bani Yas director Saleh Ismail told UAE newspaper Al-Bayan.
"Abou-Treika underwent medical scans that showed he needs for a week to recover from the injury," he added.
"He was expected to be included in Bani Yas squad for Al-Faisaly game but he suffered the injury during Monday's training and he didn't complete the sessions," Ismail concluded.
The 34-year-old Egyptian star scored two goals in as many appearances with Bani Yas, one against during his debut in a domestic cup game and the second during the 5-0 win over Dubai FC in the UAE’s Professional League.
The Egyptian playmaker joined Bani Yas from Egyptian giants Ahly on loan until the end of the current season.
