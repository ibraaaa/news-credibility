Syria regime ready to talk 'with all who want dialogue': Muallem
The regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad is ready to talk with all parties, including armed groups, who want dialogue to end the conflict, Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem said on Monday at the start of talks with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.
"We are ready for dialogue with all who want dialogue, including those who are carrying arms," Muallem said at the Moscow talks with Lavrov, who warned there was "no acceptable alternative" to a political solution and that further bloodshed risked Syria's collapse.
