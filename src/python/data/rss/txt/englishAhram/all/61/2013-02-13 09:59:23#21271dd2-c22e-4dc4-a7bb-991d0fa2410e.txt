Mali's Sissoko happy to return to Italy
The Malian midfielder expresses delight over his return to Italy for a second Serie A spell
Malian midfielder Mohamed Sissoko said on Wednesday he is looking forward to his second Italian Serie A adventure after joining Fiorentina.
The 28-year-old, who spent three years with Serie A giants Juventus (2008-2011), has agreed to join Fiorentina on loan until the rest of the season from French side Paris Saint Germain, where he was given limited opportunities to prove his worth.
"I am very happy to return to Italy for a second time," Sissoko told French magazine France football on Wednesday.
"I hope to produce impressive performances during my upcoming short spell at Fiorentina," he added.
Former Liverpool midfielder Sissoko helped Mali to a deserved third place at the last Africa Cup of Nations after they defeated Ghana in the third-place playoff.
