English-born midfielder Emmanuel Frimpong earns his first Ghana call-up for their upcoming World Cup qualifier against Sudan
Ghana's 24-man squad for their upcoming World Cup qualifier against Sudan on 26 March included English-born midfielder Emmanuel Frimpong
Frimpong, who played for England's youth teams, was cleared by world governing body FIFA to play for Ghana in November 2011 but incumbent coach Kwesi Appiah is the first Ghanaian coach to offer him the chance to play for the Black Stars.
The 21-year-old was loaned from Arsenal to Fulham for one season to gain more experience before rejoining the London's outfit.
Appiah also named three uncapped players in Baba Rahman of German Bundesliga club Greuther Furth, Sweden-based David Accam and Hearts of Oak striker Mahatma Otoo.
