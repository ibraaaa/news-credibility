Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi receives Qatari invitation to Arab League Summit
Morsi received an invitation on Tuesday hand-written by prince of Qatar Hamad Bin Khalifa Al-Thani,
 and delivered by Qatar's ambassador to Cairo Saif Bin Moqadam Al-Boenain. 
According to Al-Ahram Arabic-language news website, Morsi said that he is looking forward to what can be achieved at the summit noting how critical and challenging a period for it is for the region.
Qatar has been a prominent source of foreign aid to Egypt since the January 25 Revolution in 2011.
Qatar's finance minister Youssef Kamal told Reuters on Monday that his country has given Egypt 5 billion dollars to date but does not plan to give anymore presently.
