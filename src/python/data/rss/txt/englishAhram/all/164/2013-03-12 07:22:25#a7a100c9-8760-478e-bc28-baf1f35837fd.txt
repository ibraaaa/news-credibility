Anything can happen in football, says Arsenal's Gervinho ahead of Bayern clash
The Ivorian forward believes Arsenal still have a chance against Bayern Munich in Wednesday's tough encounter at Bayern Munich in the second leg of the Champions League round of 16
Arsenal's Ivorian forward Gervinho is confident his side can still overcome a 3-1 first-leg deficit when they face German side Bayern Munich in the second leg of the first Knockout round of the UEFA Champions League at the Allianz Arena.
"We know it is not going to be an easy match. It is not easy to come back from 3-1 against Bayern Munich," Gervinho told the Daily Star on Tuesday.
"They are one of the best teams in the world with good players all over the pitch, so we are expecting a tough game, but we must remain confident."
Last year's finalists Bayern outplayed a toothless and vulnerable Arsenal side at the Emirates Stadium to come within a touching distance of a quarter-final appearance.
"We scored at the Emirates against them and you never know, a miracle can happen. If we score an early goal it will put them under pressure," Gervinho added.
"We just need to keep positive and give everything we have. We all know anything can happen in football. This is a completely new match. We are only at half-time in this tie, and we must go there with belief.
"The players will go and give absolutely everything. We have to believe in our talents. Personally, I still believe we can make it. I know it will be difficult, but I still believe in us.
"We are going through a tough period at the moment. But there is still a really good spirit with this group."
