Demba Ba, Cisse called up by Senegal for World Cup qualifier against Angola
Former club mates Demba Ba and Papiss Demba Cisse will lead Senegal's attack in this month's World Cup qualifier against Angola after being named in a 23-man squad on Tuesday
The pair, who were at Newcastle United before Ba's move to Chelsea in January, will play together for the first time in the qualifiers for the 2014 World Cup in Brazil after Ba missed the first two Group J matches last June.
They are among a full-strength squad named by new coach Alain Giresse, who told a news conference he had no reason to make any drastic changes to the squad for the March 23 match.
He did, however, add defenders Pape Gueye and Lamine Gassama to the squad after they were not called up for last month's friendly against Guinea.
Senegal lead the group by two points but must play their home match against Angola in neutral Conakry, Guinea because of a year-long home ban after violence in Dakar last October during an African Nations Cup qualifier against Ivory Coast.
The 23-man list
Goalkeepers : Bouna Coundoul, Ousmane Mané, Cheikh Tidiane Ndiaye.
Defenders : Bayal Sall, Cheikhou Kouaye, Lamine Gassama, Lamine Sané, Cheikh Mbengue, Armand Traoré, Zarko Toure, Pape Gueye
Midfielders: Mouhamed Diame, Pape Couly Diop, Idrissa Gana Gueye, Rémi Gomis, Issiar Dia, Sadio Mane
Forwards: Abdoulaye Sane, Mame Birame Diouf, Moussa Sow, Issiar Dia, Demba Ba, Papiss Demba Cisse, Dame Ndoye
