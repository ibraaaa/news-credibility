Egypt cabinet to review ban on new satellite channels
Egyptian cabinet agrees to reassess 2011 ban on issuing permits for new privately-owned satellite channels
The Egyptian cabinet has decided to reconsider its ban on issuing licenses for the establishment of new private satellite channels, according to a Ministry of Investment press release on Thursday.
The decision, made during a cabinet meeting on 6 March, comes as a response to Egypt's investment minister Osama Saleh's request to reassess the ban, active since 2011.
Saleh considers private satellite channels and the media as important areas of investment for the country, which he claims Egypt could not afford to discard in its current economic predicament.
