Syria accuses Jordan of opening borders for jihadists
Damascus accuses Jordan of opening its borders and permitting the entrance of weapons coming from Saudi Arabia, claiming it could 'intensify the conflict'
A Syrian security official on Friday accused Jordan of opening its borders to jihadist fighters and allowing weapons bought by Saudi Arabia in Croatia to be smuggled into the country.
"We deplore the change of attitude of Jordan, which in the past 10 days has opened its borders and is allowing to cross over (into Syria) jihadists and Croatian weapons bought by Saudi Arabia," said the source.
"This can only intensify the conflict and cause more casualties," the source told AFP in Beirut on condition of anonymity.
"There's been a change of attitude because up until now, Jordan had imposed strict controls on its border to prevent the passage of terrorists and weapons," said the source, blaming "pressure by countries that are hostile to Syria" for the change.
Last week, a Croatian daily said the country was used between November and December as a "transit point" for the transport of weapons and ammunition destined for Syrian rebels fighting the regime of President Bashar al-Assad.
Some 75 civilian transport planes carrying weapons for the rebels took off from Zagreb airport between last November and February, the influential Jutarnji List reported.
It said the transportation of some 3,000 tonnes of weapons and ammunition was organised by the United States using Turkish and Jordanian air cargo companies.
The weapons originated from Croatia -- notably guns, rocket and grenade launchers -- as well as from several other European countries including Britain, which is currently leading calls to lift an EU arms embargo on Syria.
