Preview: Zamalek keeping feet on ground after impressive league start
Zamalek are not getting carried away with their superb run of form in the Egyptian Premier League as they face joint bottom side Arab Contractors on Monday
Zamalek must keep their feet on the ground after making an impressive start to their Egyptian Premier League campaign, assistant coach Osama Nabih said on Sunday.
The success-starved Cairo club, who take on struggling Arab Contractors on Monday, garnered maximum 12 points from their opening four games as they bid to win the elusive Premier League title for the first time since 2004.
“There is no room for complacency. Our recent results will not deceive us into thinking that our mission is easy,” Nabih said on the club’s official website.
“We will be seeking a win tomorrow to maintain our position on top of the league table,” he added.
Zamalek, whose brand of attacking football proved too strong for their opponents in the first four matches, are still haunted by consistent financial problems which prompted Brazilian coach Jorvan Vieira to say “patience has limits”, in an implicit warning that he would no longer accept not receiving his salary.
The players were equally frustrated but still agreed to play until the problem is resolved.
Zamalek, who are on top of the league due to their better goal difference than Ismaily, are firm favourites to beat Contractors, who lie second from bottom in the league’s new two-group format with a solitary point.
The White Knights will only miss in-form playmaker Mohamed Ibrahim, who will serve the second of a two-match ban imposed after he was sent off following a brawl with an opponent in the team’s 1-0 victory over Dakhleya.
