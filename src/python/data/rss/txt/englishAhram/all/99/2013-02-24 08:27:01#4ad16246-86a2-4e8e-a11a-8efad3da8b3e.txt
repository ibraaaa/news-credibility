French photographer dies after Syria shelling: ministry
French freelance photographer Olivier Voisin, who was seriously wounded in Syria, has died of his wounds after surgery in Turkey
French freelance photographer Olivier Voisin, who was seriously wounded in Syria on Thursday, has died of his wounds after surgery in Turkey, the foreign ministry said.
"We confirm his death," a ministry spokeswoman said on Sunday. Voisin, 38, had suffered head and arm injuries from shrapnel when a shell exploded near Idlib in northern Syria.
Turkish surgeons operated on Voisin on Friday in the border city of Antakya.
His pictures have been published in major French and British newspapers and he collaborated with AFP in January, providing about a dozen pictures from Aleppo.
Apart from Syria, he also covered news events in Libya, Somalia, Brazil, Haiti, Kenya and the United States.
Voisin was born in South Korea but was adopted by a French family.
