Egypt seeks tourism ties with Iran
Egyptian tourism minister heads to Tehran to cement new cooperation between the countries
Egypt’s tourism minister, Hisham Zaazou, will head to the Iranian capital Tehran Sunday to discuss enhancing touristic exchanges between the two countries.
Zaazou confirmed that the Egyptian government is keen to explore new tourist markets, adding that he will meet with Iranian tourism agents to set specific rules for Iranian tourists visiting Egypt.
Earlier this month, Iranian Minister of Foreign Affairs Ali Salehy announced that "Tehran will exempt tourists and traders coming to Iran from Egypt from visa requirements."
The announcement came after President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad became the first Iranian leader to visit Egypt since Tehran's 1979 Islamic revolution. Ahmadinejad called for a new strategic alliance with Cairo.
