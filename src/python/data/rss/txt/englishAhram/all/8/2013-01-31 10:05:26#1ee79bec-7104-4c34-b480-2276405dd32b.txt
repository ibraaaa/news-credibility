Elmohamady rejoins Hull City on loan from Sunderland
Egyptian winger Ahmed Elmohamady returns to Hull City after penning six-month loan deal with the Championship side
Championship side Hull City have re-signed Egyptian winger Ahmed Elmohamady for the rest of the season, the team announced on Thursday.
The 25-year-old, who was loaned from Sunderland to Hull City last summer, was re-signed by coach Martin O'Neill to return to the Premier League side two weeks ago. But he soon returned to Hull City after signing a six-month loan deal.
Elmohamady's return comes as the club completes loan deals for Ahly duo Ahmed Fathi and Mohamed Nagy 'Gedo', both of whom are set to play for Hull City for the rest of the current season.
The Egyptian winger, for his part, expressed delight over his fellow Egyptians' move.
"Glad to have my compatriots Gedo and Fathi at Hull. Welcome new Tigers!" Elmohamady said via Twitter on Thursday.
The club's Egyptian Chairman Assem Allam is trying to boost the team's squad to clinch a promotion to the Premier League at the end of the season.
Hull City are now third of the table with 50 points, 10 behind leaders Cardiff City.
