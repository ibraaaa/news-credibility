UN leader has 'grave concern' over reported Israeli attack
UN leader Ban Ki-moon is gravely concerned about reports of an Israeli air strike on Syria but cannot independently verify what happened, a spokesman said Thursday.
Ban noted the reported strike with "grave concern," said deputy UN spokesman Eduardo del Buey. "The secretary general calls on all concerned to prevent tensions or their escalation in the region."
