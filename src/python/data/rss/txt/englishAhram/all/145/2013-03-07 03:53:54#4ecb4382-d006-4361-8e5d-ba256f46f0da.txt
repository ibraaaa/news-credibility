Zamalek eager for victory over El-Entag on Friday
El-Entag desperate to prove themselves against undefeated Zamalek after run of poor performances so far this season
The match between Zamalek and El-Entag El-Harby on Friday promises to be hard-fought as both clubs have everything to play for.
Zamalek are eager to retain this season’s unbeaten record and further extend their lead over rivals Ismaily at the top of the table.
El-Entag are determined to perform well after registering three draws and a loss so far this season.
"We are working to finish the first round of the league with no defeats so as to play the second round with no pressure," Zamalek assistant coach Osama Nabih is quoted as saying on the club's official website.
Commenting on the other side he added, "The El-Entag El-Harby game will be difficult” as they cannot afford to miss an opportunity to gain another three points. Losing on Friday will leave El-Entag with three points compared to Zamalek’s 18.
Cameroonian midfielder Alexis Mendomo will be joined by forward Mohamed Ibrahim on Friday, after the latter’s two-game suspension for a red card ended. However, Zamalek will be without winger Hazem Emam because of a muscle injury, while goalkeeper Mahmoud Gennish and midfielder Hamada Tolba have been sidelined for technical reasons. Goalkeeper Ahmed El-Shennawy is replacing Gennish for the first time this season.
"I ask the team's players to do their best throughout the game to snatch the Group B lead away from the nearest opponent," Osama Nabih concluded.
