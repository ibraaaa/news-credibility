Military casualties during SCAF rule revealed for first time
Egyptian defence ministry publishes data showing 55 military personnel died during period of military rule following January 25 Revolution
The data covers the period from 30 January 2011 until 29 July 2012 and was published to coincide with Martyrs Day on 9 March.
The data was not released during the rule of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF) to avoid damaging soldiers' morale whilst they were active on the streets, the statement said.
Among the 55 dead were one brigadier general, 11 officers and 43 soldiers.
One military policeman was killed during the Maspero clashes between mostly Christian protesters and military police on 9 October 2012, the statement said.
A soldier from the Thunderbolt Forces – part of the Egyptian Special Forces – was killed during clashes at the defence ministry on 4 May 2012, the statement added.
Most of the deaths were caused by car accidents or during fights with outlaw criminal gangs.
