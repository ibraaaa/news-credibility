I'm responsible for CAN exit: Ivory Coast coach
Ivory Coast Coach takes on the responsibility for the CAN 2013 exit; Drogba says 'it's over'
Ivory Coast coach Sabri Lamouchi admits that he and his team's players failed to achieve their 2013 African Cup of Nations campaign after losing 2-1 to Nigeria on Sunday, which means they are out of the quarterfinals.
"I assume all the responsibility," Lamouchi told the post game press conference.
"We had our chances to take control of the match but we lacked simplicity in our build up," he added.
The 41-year-old tactician Lamouchi, who was named as Ivory Coast’s new coach in May, was targeting to guide the Elephants to win the 2013 African Cup of Nations’ title.
"The goal was to win this Afcon tournament, but unfortunately we didn't do it," Lamouchi said.
"It's disappointing for the players and myself. I'm accountable, we've lost, but we've played,"
"We did what we were supposed to do. The players were there and they were trying to catch up."
The Elephant and former Chelsea icon Didier Drogba, who was tipped to win the title, was angry after being eliminated from the CAN 2013 saying "It's over."
The 34-year-old attacker revealed also that the Ivory Coast team will concentrate on the World Cup qualifiers hinting he may be out of it.  
"We now look ahead to the World Cup, with or without me." Drogba announced.
