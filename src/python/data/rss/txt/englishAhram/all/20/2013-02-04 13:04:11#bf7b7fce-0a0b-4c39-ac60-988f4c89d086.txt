AUC to host 'teaching art in MENA' conference in March
A three-day conference at the American University in Cairo to discuss the changing practices of art education in light of political and economic transformations
The American University in Cairo is organising a conference themed ‘Pedagogy, Performance and Practice: Teaching Art in the Middle East and North Africa' from 19-21 March, in cooperation with the Goethe Institute, The British Council and the US Embassy in Cairo.
“While the arts are playing significant roles in the complex transitions of Arab nations today as they move from traditional to more contemporary forms, in Egypt and North Africa in general there is a significant discrepancy between the content of art programmes offered by academic institutions and the professional practices of the global contemporary art world,” reads the press release.
Over the course of the three-day conference, held in English at the Tahrir Square and New Cairo campuses, exhibitions and performances by local, regional and international artists will take place alongside discussions over relevant practical and pedagogical approaches to tackling the standards of art education in the Middle East and North Africa region.
“The conference will discuss how traditional and alternative art programmes are re-imagining their roles as the political and economic landscape changes and how academic institutions engage in this seeming wide gap between art pedagogy and practice, as well as examine the impact of pedagogy in curatorial practice and museum behaviour,” the American University in Cairo said.
