Adel Imam to become 'The Godfather' at Ramadan
Egyptian actor Adel Imam to star in new television comedy series entitled 'El-Aarab' at Ramadan
Following his success last Ramadan with his television series 'Ferket Nagi Atallah' (Nagi Atallah's Gang), Egyptian actor Adel Imam confirms his return to the screen with 'El-Aarab' (The Godfather) this Ramadan, Al-Ahram Arabic website reports.
"I am not intending to leave cinema for television, but I seek to put a smile on people's faces with my shows and take them away from the depressing political situation," he says.
"I don't see anything around us today that can make us happy," he adds.
Filming will begin in the coming days.
Joining Imam will be over 150 actors, including Hussein Fahmy and comedian Talaat Zakaria.
'El-Aarab' is directed by Ramy Imam and written by Youssef Moaty.
