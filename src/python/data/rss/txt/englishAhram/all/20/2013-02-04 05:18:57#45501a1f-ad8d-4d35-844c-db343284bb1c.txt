Egypt goalie El-Hadary announces retirement plans
Essam El-Hadary is planning to quit football if Egypt qualifies for the 2014 World Cup
Egypt goalkeeper Essam El-Hadary has announced he will only retire if the Pharaohs qualify for the 2014 World Cup in Brazil.
“I hope I can accomplish an unforgettable success with my national team before I leave the green field,” the 40-year-old goalie, who currently plays for Sudanese side Merriekh, wrote on his official Facebook page Wednesday.
The winners of seven Africa Cup of Nations trophies, absent from the current tournament, haven't qualified for the World Cup since 1990.
They will host Zimbabwe in March in their third match in the World Cup qualifiers group stage.
They are leading Group G with six points from two games, three ahead of second-placed Guinea. Zimbabwe and Mozambique hold one point each.
