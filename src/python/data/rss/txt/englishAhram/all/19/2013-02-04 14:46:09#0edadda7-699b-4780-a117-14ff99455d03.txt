Cirque du Soleil's 'Dralion' comes to the Middle East
The circus company brings its new acrobatic spectacle to the UAE and Lebanon
The show is described as "a harmonious blend of Eastern and Western acrobatic prowess" fusing Chinese acrobatic arts with the multidisciplinary approach of Cirque du Soleil, with a name that mingles the Eastern dragon and the Western lion.
The show's multi-talented performers present a variety of high-calibre acts including teeterboard, ballet on lights, hoop diving, bamboo poles, juggling, single hand balancing, double trapeze, and skipping ropes.
The show will visit Dubai in UAE, then move to Lebanon, with those dates still to be scheduled.
Programme
Dubai World Trade Centre, 6-16 February
