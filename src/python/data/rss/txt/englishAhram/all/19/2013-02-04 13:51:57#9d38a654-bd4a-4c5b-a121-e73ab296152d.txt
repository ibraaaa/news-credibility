Cristiano Ronaldo is happy to face former club Manchester United for first time since he joined Real Madrid in 2009
Real Madrid forward Cristiano Ronaldo has expressed his pleasure at facing his former team Manchester United in the European Champions League on 14 February for the first time in his career since he joined the Spanish giants in 2009.
"It will be very nice. I still talk to many United players like Rio, Patrice, Nani, Anderson. They are always joking with me," Ronaldo was quoted as saying by Spanish newspaper Marca on Monday.
"It will be great to see them again, even though it will be a very difficult game," he added.
The Whites are scheduled to face Manchester United in the quarterfinal of the European Champions League on 14 February.
Ronaldo believes that this game will be decided from the bench as the two sides have great coaches.
"Manchester United are the best team in England. Every year they win something. And they have a fantastic coach in Sir Alex Ferguson, but we have Jose Mourinho, he is my coach now, so obviously I hope Mourinho wins," Ronaldo said.
"It is like comparing a Ferrari with a Porsche, both are very good, very experienced and both always want to win."
The 27-year-old Portuguese attacker believes all eyes will be on him as he faces his former club for the first time since he left them.
Reporters have claimed he will join Manchester United after he his current contract with Real Madrid expires.
"I know that there will be much attention on me, but for me there is no pressure, it's only one game, a football game against my old club.
"I'm not going to go to war, I come home and I'm very excited about it.
"Manchester was my home and is still in my heart," Ronaldo concluded.
