FIFA to change football offside law
Soccer panel to consider changing offside law and to examine closing a loophole regarding uncontested dropped balls
FIFA's rules-making panel will consider changing how the offside law is interpreted at its annual meeting next month.
FIFA says the panel, known as IFAB, will also examine closing a loophole regarding uncontested dropped balls, after a controversial goal scored by Shakhtar Donetsk against Nordsjaelland in the Champions League.
The group comprising FIFA and four British soccer associations will be updated on introducing goal-line technology at the 2014 World Cup when it meets March 1-2 in Edinburgh, Scotland.
FIFA says its refereeing department suggests tweaking offside rules to clarify when forwards standing in an offside position can legally influence play.
