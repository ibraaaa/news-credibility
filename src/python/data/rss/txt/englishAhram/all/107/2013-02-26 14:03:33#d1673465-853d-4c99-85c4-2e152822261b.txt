Janet Jackson says she has married Qatari billionaire
Janet Jackson says she wed Qatari businessman Wissam Al-Mana last year in a private ceremony
Singer Janet Jackson said on Monday that she married her Qatari businessman boyfriend last year, quashing media reports of upcoming nuptials.
Jackson, 46, the younger sister of the late singer Michael Jackson, was engaged to billionaire Wissam Al-Mana, 37, last year but kept the news under wraps.
"The rumoirs regarding an extravagant wedding are simply not true. Last year we were married in a quiet, private, and beautiful ceremony," Jackson and Al-Mana said in a statement to Entertainment Tonight.
"Our wedding gifts to one another were contributions to our respective favourite children's charities."
The American singer is known for keeping her private life from the media, rarely speaking out about her ex-husbands.
She married soul singer James DeBarge in 1984, and the marriage was annulled a year later. Her 1991 marriage to music video director Rene Elizondo ended in divorce in 2000.
