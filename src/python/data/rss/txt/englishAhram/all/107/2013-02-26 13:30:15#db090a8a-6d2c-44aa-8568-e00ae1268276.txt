Egypt legend Hossam Hassan appointed Maqassa boss
Former coach of Zamalek, Ismaily and Masry, Hossam Hassan, succeeds Mohamed Abdel-Jalil as Maqassa head coach
Egyptian Premier League club Maqassa have appointed Hossam Hassan as coach until the end of the season.
The former Zamalek, Ismaily and Masry coach will be assisted by his twin, football director Ibrahim Hassan.
"After negotiations that lasted a week, Hossam and his twin brother Ibrahim officially signed with Maqassa in the early hours of Tuesday," Al-Ahram Sport revealed.
The 46-year-old twins have been without a job since leaving their posts at Masry after the February 2012 Port Said Stadium disaster that left at least 74 football fans dead and hundreds injured.
The Hassan duo are facing a great challenge with Maqassa who are currently bottom of Group A of the Egyptian Premier League with a single point, eight behind leaders Ahly.
