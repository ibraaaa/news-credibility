UK's Prince Charles and his wife Camilla visit a Jordanian camp hosting Syrian refugees
Britain's Prince Charles and his wife Camilla on Wednesday visited a camp for Syrian refugees in northern Jordan as part of a trip to the Middle East, an official said.
The royal couple toured the United Nations-run King Abdullah Park refugee camp near the border with Syria that hosts about 1,000 Syrians who have fled the war in their country, said the Jordanian government official.
"They were briefed by UN officials on the situation (of the refugees)," the official told AFP.
Later on Wednesday, their second day in Jordan, the British prince and duchess are to visit the northern Greco-Roman city of Jerash, before leaving for Qatar, followed by Saudi Arabia and Oman.
Jordan says it is sheltering nearly 436,000 Syrian refugees, including 120,000 at the Zaatari camp, situated in a desert region in the north of the country. It expects the number to surge to 700,000 by the end of 2013.
