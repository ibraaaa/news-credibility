Brazil to take on Bolivia in charity match
Brazil team is unlikely to feature European-based players against Bolivia
Brazil will play Bolivia in a friendly with all proceeds from the match to be donated to the family of a 14-year-old fan who was killed by a firework during a recent Copa Libertadores game.
The match will take place on April 5 in the Bolivian city of Santa Cruz de la Sierra.
The Brazilian team would pay their own costs and hand their share of the gate money to Kelvin Beltran's family, Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF) President Jose Maria Marin said.
"They will go, play and come back on the same day," Marin said. "It's a sacrifice, but they will do it to show sporting solidarity, not just on behalf of the CBF but from the Brazilian people."
Bolivian police arrested 12 fans of Sao Paulo-based club Corinthians and charged them with homicide after a firework set off in the away end hit San Jose fan Beltran, killing him instantly, on Feb. 20.
A 17-year-old Brazilian later turned himself in to authorities and took responsibility. All 13 are still in police custody.
April 5 is not an official FIFA date so the Brazil team is unlikely to feature European-based players.
