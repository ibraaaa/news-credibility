India willing to export wheat to Egypt: Supply minister
Egypt could start importing Indian wheat in an effort to start diversifying its grain imports
The Indian government has proposed exporting wheat to Egypt and said it is ready to provide 'generous' financial facilities to encourage Egyptian imports, Egypt's Supply Minister Bassem Ouda told state-owned news agency MENA on Wednesday.
Ouda, speaking after a meeting with the Indian ambassador in Cairo, said the government would start assessing the quality of Indian wheat and include it on the list of commodities Egypt can import.
The minister said importing Indian wheat would be a 'positive' step, and that Egypt must learn from the success of India which used to be a wheat importer. In less than 10 years India was able to develop its agricultural sector and achieve a yearly wheat surplus of almost 16 tonnes.
Egypt is the world's biggest largest importer of wheat, importing an estimated 11.5 million tonnes per year.
