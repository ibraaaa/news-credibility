Sudanese protest against President Al-Bashir in Cairo
As senior Sudanese officials visit Cairo, a small group of Sudanese protesters condemns the 'crimes' of Sudanese President Omar Al-Bashir
Dozens of Sudanese protesters chanted against Sudanese President Omar Al-Bashir in front of Al-Ahram premises in Cairo on Wednesday, as a Sudanese delegation paid a visit to Al-Ahram Centre for Political and Strategic Studies.
Accompanied by police personnel holding batons, demonstrators held placards condemning the "crimes" committed by Al-Bashir's regime against children and citizens.
Speaking over a microphone, protesters chanted: "Post-revolution Egypt should not deal with the criminal regime of Al-Bashir."
Other chants demanded condemnation of the "Darfur atrocities."
Executive Chairman of the Darfur Regional Authority Tijani Sese, Sudanese investment minister Mostafa Osman, and Sudanese ambassador to Cairo Kamal El-Din Hassan were invited to take part in a forum at the Al-Ahram Centre for Political and Strategic Studies in downtown Cairo.
The protest prompted a delay in their arrival, and the delegation eventually entered through a back door.
Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi received Sudanese counterpart Omar Al-Bashir at the presidential palace in Cairo's Heliopolis district in September last year.
