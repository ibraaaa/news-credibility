Popular Lebanese rock band to perform in Cairo
Famed alternative rock band Mashrou' Leila perform live at the American University in Cairo this March
Enactus AUC, an American University in Cairo student organization that seeks to further enterpreneurial action and bring about sustainable development, is organizing a live concert by Lebanese alternative rock band Mashrou' Leila (Night Project), on 28 March.
The non profit student committee will dedicate all the money earned through tickets to funding their developmental projects. 
"This concert mixes the power of music and entrepreneurship to aid in funding our developmental projects through which we aid those in need to take control of their lives economically, socially and environmentally," says the official event announcement on Facebook.
Lebanese band Mashrou' Leila is one of the most popular bands in the contemporary Arab music scene. The band consists of five architecture students, and one graphic designer. Mashrou Leila was established in 2008, after an an open call for auditions by the three founding members Haig Papazian (violin), Andre Chedid (guitar) and Omaya Malaeb (keyboards). The idea was to start a band to relieve stress, especially in light of the enduring political instability in Lebanon.
Mashrou' Leila performed in Egypt for the first time in 2011 at El Genaina theatre and the Cairo Jazz Club, during Al Mawred Al-Thaqafy's (Culture Resource) summer programme, and in an Underground Music Federation (UMF) concert at the Niler Garden in 2012.
Programme:
Thursday, 28 March, from 6pm to 11pm
AUC New Cairo Campus
