Giza fire department officers join strike action
Several officers at Giza's fire brigade strike against interior minister's policies, joining forces with widespread police strikes across the country
Protesting officers are reiterating the demands of other police personnel whom have been on strike now for more than a week. The demands include the dismissal of the interior minister, the removal of police from political disputes with the general public and the introduction of better weapons to perform their duties.
Egypt's police are reviled by many critics for alleged excessive use of force against opponents of President Morsi and his Muslim Brotherhood.
Negotiations, led by Giza Security Directorate officials, to coax picketers into calling off their strike are currently underway.
Egypt's police officers have been staging strikes in several cities across the state since Tuesday March 5. The canal city of Ismailia was the first to  strike, with security forces refusing to deploy to the nearby city of Port Said; a scene of sporadic violent clashes between anti-government protesters and security personnel since the second anniversary of the January 25 revolution.
