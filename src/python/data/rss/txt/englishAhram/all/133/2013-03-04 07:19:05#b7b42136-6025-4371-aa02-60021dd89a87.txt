Maqassa give new coach Hassan winning debut in Egyptian league
Maqassa's new coach Hossam Hassan began his mission with a 3-1 win over Smouha in the Egyptian league on Monday
Hassan was named as Maqassa's coach last week, replacing Mohamed Abdel-Gelil who failed to impress with the team during the first four matches in the domestic league.
Striker Sameh El-Aydarous opened the scoring for Maqassa in the second minute of the game.
An own goal from Smouha's defender Abdel-Aziz Tawfik doubled the lead for Maqassa 18 minutes later before Maqassa's international striker Hussein Hamdy scored the third in the 66th minute of the game.
Smouha's Malian defender Eliassou Issiaka scored the consolation goal for his team in the 44th minute on penalty.
This win sends Maqassa to the fourth place in the Egyptian league table (Group A) with seven points, two points behind leaders Haras El-Hodoud.
