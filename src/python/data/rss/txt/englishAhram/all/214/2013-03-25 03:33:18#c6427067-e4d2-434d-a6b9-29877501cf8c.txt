Egypt's cabinet condemns violence at Media City protests
PM Hisham Qandil's Cabinet described assaults on media figures as 'reprehensible' and incompatible with democratic values
Egypt's Cabinet has condemned attacks on TV hosts at Egyptian Media Production City (EMPC) and described them as "reprehensible."
Several media figures were assaulted on Sunday as protesters gathered at the EMPC in Sixth of October City on the outskirts of Cairo to protest what they called an anti-Islamist bias of certain TV channels.  
Prime Minister's Hisham Qandil's Cabinet released a statement on Monday saying that, "[these actions] do not comply with the correct methods of expressing opinion, and do not exhibit good conduct in exercising the rights which we all aim to consolidate in building the new democratic system."
The Cabinet's spokesperson described such "violent actions as harming the image of the revolution, undermining [Egypt's] climate of confidence and negatively impacting the values of democracy."
The statement emphasized that freedom of expression is a constitutional right for every citizen and that objection should be communicated through discussion and argument.
Several media figures were verbally abused, while others found it difficult to enter the EMPC to put on their shows.
Interior minister Mohamed Ibrahim arrived at the EMPC late Sunday in an effort to convince the protesters to end their sit-in.
However, protesters continued their demonstrations at the city on Monday.
Several Islamist groups and activists called on Saturday for the protest at the EMPC following "biased media coverage" of anti-Brotherhood clashes at the Brotherhood's headquarters in Mokattam, Cairo, on Friday.
