Egypt U-20 look beyond Nigeria in African Championship semis
Egypt U-20 aim to reach the Africa youth final at the expense of Nigeria in Tuesday's semis
The Egypt U-20 side are looking to maintain their successful campaign in the Africa Youth Championship on Tuesday, when they face Nigeria in the tournament's semis.
The Egyptian team have achieved their first target in the continental tournament; just as they reached this summer’s FIFA U-20 World Cup, which will take place in Turkey, they also qualified for the Africa Youth Championship semis as group winners, following three straight wins.
Following their success in the first phase, Egypt coach Rabie Yassine and his men vowed to continue the team's campaign for the African title.
"We are determined to win the African Championship title," Yassin told an Egyptian radio station after the team's success in reaching the World Cup
But before attaining the tournament's title, the Egyptian team must get past Nigeria in Tuesday's semis.
The game will not be easy for the Egyptian team, as the Nigerian youth teams are known to be strong, but the Egyptian coach is confident about his team's capacity to overcome their opponents.
"The Nigeria clash will be different than our games in the group stage as we will have no chances to recover if we lose in the semis. It is a must win situation because otherwise we will exit the tournament," Yassin was quoted as saying by Ahram Sport on Sunday.
"We studied our opponents well and we know everything about them. We will prepare the best strategy to overcome them and reach the final," he concluded.
