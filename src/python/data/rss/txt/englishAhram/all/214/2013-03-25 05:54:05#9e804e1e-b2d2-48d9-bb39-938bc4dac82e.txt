Egypt stocks fall on Monday as uncertainty persists
Stocks drop on Monday after yesterday's strong gains, low trading volume worries traders
Egypt's bourse fell on Monday after news of Orascom Construction Industries (OCI) settling its tax dispute led the market to surge during yesterday's session.
The benchmark EGX30 index fell 0.47 percent to 5,231 points. The broader-based EGX70 index fell by 0.74 percent.
Around 107 stocks fell on Monday, headed by heavyweight shares Orascom Construction Industries (OCI) and Commercial International Bank (CIB) which dropped 0.77 per cent and 0.61 percent respectively.
"The market is still suffering from a lack of liquidity, there is still no real incentive to invest, and of course Friday's violence is the main factor negatively affecting the stock exchange," capital markets expert Mustafa Badra told Ahram Online.
Analysts had expected clashes last Friday between supporters and opponents of the Muslim Brotherhood in Cairo and in several other cities to eventually lead investors to exit the market.
Trade volume remains eerily low at a mere LE211 million on Monday, as analysts expect further economic volatility.
"Market volume is the real indicator of the market's condition, the current rate simply showcases how Egypt's stock exchange is weak," explained Badra.
Egyptian and Arab investors were net buyers for the day picking up LE21 million and LE12 million worth of shares respectively.
Foreign investors were net sellers, offloading a significant LE33 million worth of shares.
The real estate sector performed poorly on Monday, with market giants Talaat Mustafa Group Holding (TMGH) and Palm Hills stumbling by 0.77 and 0.94 percent respectively.
