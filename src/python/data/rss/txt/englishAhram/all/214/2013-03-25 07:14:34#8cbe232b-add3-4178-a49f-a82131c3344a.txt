Gaddafi's family moved to Oman: Libyan FM
Family members of Libya's Muammar Gaddafi who had taken refuge in Algeria during the revolution that toppled the long-time dictator have now moved to Oman, Libya's foreign minister said on Monday.
"Some of the family has moved to Oman," Mohammed Abdelaziz told reporters in Doha following reports that Gaddafi's relatives who fled to Algeria in August 2011 had now left that country.
Abdelaziz said an official statement by the three countries involved, Libya, Algeria and Oman, would be issued soon.
Omani local daily Al-Shabiba said on Monday that some members of Gaddafi's family have been in Oman since October.
It cited a foreign ministry official saying that the Gulf state did not want to "show off" with an action prompted by "humanitarian" motives.
Gaddafi's wife Safia and two sons, Hannibal and Mohammed, along with daughter Aisha sought refuge in Algeria after the fall of Tripoli in August 2011 to rebels battling the veteran leader's loyalists.
Another son, Saadi, fled to Niger in September that year.
Three of Gaddafi's sons, Mutassim, Seif al-Arab and Khamis, were killed during the conflict in separate incidents.
The dictator's most prominent son Seif al-Islam, who was once touted as a potential successor, was arrested in November 2011 and is awaiting trial.
Gaddafi himself was killed in his hometown of Sirte in October 2011.
