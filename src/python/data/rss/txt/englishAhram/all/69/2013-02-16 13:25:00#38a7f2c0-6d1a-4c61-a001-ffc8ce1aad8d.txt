One killed, 20 arrested in Friday Gharbiya clashes: Official reports
One person was hit by a car and killed during riots in Gharbiya Friday, with 20 others arrested on charges of attacking governorate buildings
One person was killed in clashes in Gharbiya governorate Friday after being hit by a car, Mohamed Sultan, head of the Egyptian Ambulance Authority, told Egypt's state-run MENA news agency Saturday.
According to Gharbiya Security Director General Hatem Osman, the person died during Friday's riots while engaged in "damaging vehicles." He was hit by a speeding car.
Osman said that 20 rioters were arrested in the clashes on charges of attacking the governorate's administration building, security directorate, Mahalla city council, and attempting to storm a police station in Tanta city.
Anti-Muslim Brotherhood protests took place in the central Delta governorate of Mahalla Friday when hundreds went out in a rally to demand justice for slain activist Mohamed El-Gendy, who died of severe injuries after being detained by police following anti-government demonstrations two weeks ago. Activists allege that he was tortured while in detention and these injuries led to his death. 
Riots broke out in many places, including his home town, between groups of protesters and the police after his death.
According to Egypt's Ministry of Health, 21 people were injured in Gharbiya Friday.
The total number of security forces injured reached 14, including one Central Security Forces (CSF) officer and 13 CSF conscripts, Osman said.
About 125 people were injured nationwide in Friday's protests and clashes, including in Cairo at Al-Qubba Palace, where President Mohamed Morsi has moved his administration, and in Giza, in Beni-Suef governorate, and Al-Daqahliya governorate.
