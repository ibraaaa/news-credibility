Egypt striker Amr Zaki returns to ENPPI
The free agent signs a two-year contract with his former club ENPPI after terminating his deal with Turkish side Elazigspor
Egypt striker Amr Zaki has signed a two-year contract with Egyptian Premier League side ENPPI after terminating his deal with Turkey's Elazigspor by mutual consent after less than five months of joining them.
"The deal is done, Zaki signed for ENPPI FC until 2015," read a statement on the player's personal Facebook page on Friday.
The 29-year-old forward, who joined the Elazig-based club late August and was supposed to stay for two seasons, had agreed with the club to leave amicably last month.
The former Zamalek striker made eight appearances in the Turkish league; last one was on 24 November against Galatasaray when he was substituted due to injury.
Zaki scored 36 goals for ENPPI during his previous stint at the petroleum club before moving to Zamalek in 2006, where he was loaned to English Premier League side Wigan Athletic in 2008-2009 and scored 11 goals in 33 matches. He also had a short spell at Hull City where he made six appearances.
