President Morsi's office confirms spokesperson resigned
Presidency says Spokesman Yasser Ali will stay until March and will be reshuffled into another position, denies rumours a key Morsi campaigner was tapped for the interim role
Presidency announces Spokesperson Yasser Ali will leave his position in March and will head the Cabinet's Information and Decision Support Centre (IDSC).
"We express our heartfelt gratitude to Dr Yasser Ali for his remarkable work and congratulate him on the IDSC Chairmanship," the presidency's statement said.
The statement, which was also published on Ali's official Facebook page, has confirmed that Ali will remain in his position until the beginning of March, where a new press office will be established that will include more than one spokesperson.
Since Thursday night, reports circulated that Ali requested to resign and shortly afterwards it was announced that he will be appointed to head the Cabinet's IDSC.
Since the reports were released, rumours from inside the presidential office circulated about the temporary appointment of young, leading Muslim Brotherhood cadre and President Morsi's former spokesman during his presidential campaign, Dr Ahmed Abdel-Aty, as acting spokesperson.
Saturday's statement, however, appears to dismiss such claims.
Earlier, presidency sources told Al-Ahram Arabic news website that Ali wanted another position where he didn't have to deal with the media for a while, which he felt was personally attacking him.
Ali is a Muslim Brotherhood member and a former spokesperson for its Freedom and Justice Party.
