Cairo airport steps up security ahead of planned anti-Morsi protests
Activists call for demonstration at Cairo International Airport to protest planned employment of President Morsi's son by state-owned Holding Company for Airport and Aviation
Cairo International Airport authorities have stepped up security at the airport’s entrances and gates in anticipation of possible Sunday protests against the appointment of President Mohamed Morsi’s son to an airport position, an anonymous airport official said.
The official told Ahram Online that Egypt’s Central Security Forces were surrounding civil aviation ministry headquarters, located some 100 metres from the airport.
“They [CSF] are preparing for possible demonstrations against the employment of Omar Mohamed Morsi, the son of the Egyptian president, at the state-owned Holding Company for Airport and Aviation,” the anonymous official said.
Planned demonstrations are expected to head from central Cairo’s Abbasiya district to civil aviation ministry headquarters. Demonstrators claim Morsi’s son obtained the position through favouritism and nepotism.
On Friday, Aviation Minister Wael El-Maadawi told official news agency MENA that Omar Morsi had obtained the position through legitimate employment channels.
Earlier on Sunday, Omar wrote on Facebook that he would not take the job due to charges that he would be paid a massive salary, when in fact, he stated, his monthly salary would have only amounted to some LE900.
It remains unclear whether activists calling for the Sunday protest would cancel the event after the younger Morsi’s decision not to take the job.
