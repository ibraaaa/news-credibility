Independent Moscars Al-Hurria film festival accepting submissions
The third round of Moscars Al-Hurria Film Festival, an independent, self-funded cinematic event, will take place in April and is now accepting submissions
Organised by the 3738Life Group, Moscars Al-Hurria is an independent film festival showcasing short and feature films, documentaries, animation and video art produced by artists and filmmakers from across the globe. The festival will take place from 10-19 April, and is accepting submissions until 28 March.
Moscars Al-Hurria first appeared in 2010 and was associated with the online-based Moscars Cinema club. Moscars is an initiative by Mariam Selim and Karim Aly, two medical students with a passion for the arts. The festival seeks to feature films by rising directors and stir up conversations over art and public interest in cinema.
Aiming to support emerging directors and stimulate creative exchange, this year's festival will include discussions with filmmakers following the screening of the films.
The nine-day festival, which will take place at the Heliopolis Association's Library in April, is completely self-funded. The organisers explain on the festival website that Moscars Al-Hurria is the biggest independent cinematic event in the Middle East because it does not receive external funding.
"Unlike other film festivals or art events, we reject the idea of art for money, for fame, or even for glory. We believe that art is more than just the art, the art comes from people and must be given back to people who are most capable of judging it," reads the press release.
