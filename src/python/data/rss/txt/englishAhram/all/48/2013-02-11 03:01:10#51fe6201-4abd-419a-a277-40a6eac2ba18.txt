Zamalek coach seeks fans support in Champions League
Vieira comments over the team’s heavy schedule and the delay of Gazelle FC Champions League tie
Zamalek Brazilian manager Jorvan Vieira is pleased that the club got the approval on delaying their opening African Champions League game against Gazelle FC of Chad for 24 hours to be held on 17 February.
“The Egyptian Premier League heavy schedule is the reason why we asked to postpone the match in order not to exhaust our players,” Vieira was quoted as saying on the club’s official website.
Vieira took charge of Zamalek for the first time this season after returning from the United Arab Emirates, where he stayed longer than scheduled during the Egyptian league’s lengthy suspension, fuelling reports that he would depart.
“We are hoping that we can continue our domestic success and gain the fans support in the Africa Champions League competition,” the 59-year-old added.
Zamalek, who have not won any title since lifting the Egypt Cup trophy in 2008, top Group B with a maximum six points from two games.
In a new two-group format, the winners of the two groups will advance to play a mini-league, with only home fixtures to determine the champion. The competition is being played behind closed doors at military-owned stadiums due to security concerns.
