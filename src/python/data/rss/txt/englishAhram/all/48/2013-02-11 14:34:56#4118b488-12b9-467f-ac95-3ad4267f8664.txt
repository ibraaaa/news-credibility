Ahly’s Seddik to miss African Super Cup
Ahmed Seddik injured during Ahly’’s 1-0 win over Wadi Degla game Sunday
Ahly right winger Ahmed Seddik is likely to miss Africa Super Cup match, scheduled for 23 February, due to injury.
Seddik has sustained a muscle strain during his side’s 1-0 win over Wadi-Degla in round two of Group A of the Egyptian Premier League.
The 29-year-old will undergo medical scans Monday to determine the seriousness of his injury.
Seddik was substituted in the 20th minute of Degla’s game to Sherif Abdel-Fadil.
“I didn’t want to risk leaving Seddik in the field after he appeared injured and the team’s Dr. Ehab Ali confirmed to me he really needs to substituted,” Ahly manager Hossam El-Badry told reporters after the match.
Ahly, who won the last league edition in 2011 and were leading the table when it was cancelled last year in the wake of the Port Said disaster, garnered maximum six points from two games after beating Ghazl El-Mahalla 1-0 in the league opener.
