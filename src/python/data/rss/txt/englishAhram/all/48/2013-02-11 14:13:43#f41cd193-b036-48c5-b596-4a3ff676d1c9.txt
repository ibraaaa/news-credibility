Ahly coach satisfied over Degla ‘hard’ victory

Ahly manager Hossam El-Badry expressed his satisfaction over the team’s performance during round two of Group A of the Egyptian Premier League against Wadi Degla.
“Players accomplished the victory and this is what they need especially as we are missing seven players due to injuries and loans,” the Red Devils coach told media after they gained their second successive win in the new format Egyptian league.
El-Badry praised Degla’s performance after the 1-0 win scored by veteran defender Wael Gomaa.
“It was a hard game. We were forced to substitute Emad Mete [striker] to Rami Rabea [defender] to support Ahmed Shedid [winger] defending the left wing from Degla’s attacks,” the 52-year-old added.
The Africa Champions League holders are missing the efforts of key players as midfielder Mohamed Abou-Treika who is loaned to UAE’s Bani Yas while defender Ahmed Fathi and striker Mohamed Nagi ‘Gedo’ are loaned to England’s Hull city. Defenders Hossam Ghaly and Sayed Moawad and midfielder Walid Soliman are suffering injuries.
