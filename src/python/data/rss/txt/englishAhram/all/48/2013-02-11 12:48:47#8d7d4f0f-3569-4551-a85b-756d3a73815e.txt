Swan Lake one of the most well-known ballets. In fact, it is a centrepiece in the repertoire of many ballet troupes. It has been performed by the Cairo Opera Ballet Company on many occasions between 1991 and 2003. After 2003, Swan Lake was no longer staged at the Cairo Opera House, until 2011 when the choreography was practically rebuilt from scratch. Since then the ballet has been performed several times
