Ahly fans commemorate victims of Port Said football disaster
Hardcore fans flock to Ahly's training stadium to mark first anniversary of last year's Port Said stadium disaster
Ahly’s die-hard football fans (Ultras Ahlawy) gathered at the club’s training stadium on Friday to remember their comrades who were killed in Port Said on 1 February, 2012.
Thousands of the enthusiastic supporters, who relentlessly pushed for justice after over 70 Ahly were killed in Egypt’s worst-ever football disaster, held a memorial service at the club’s headquarters in Al-Gazeera district, Cairo.
They used their bodies to form the number 74 on the pitch, in reference to the number of those killed after they were confronted by the home Masry fans following the end of an ill-tempered Egyptian Premier League game in Port Said.
They also held a five-minute silence at the same time the disaster occurred last year.
Twenty-one Masry fans were sentenced to death for their role in the tragedy, a court verdict that sparked deadly riots in Port Said, leaving more than 40 people dead.
Three Masry club officials, nine security personnel and dozens of Masry fans will learn their fate on 9 March when the court delivers another ruling in the notorious headline-grabbing case.
