Hull City manager praises new Egypt signings
Steve Bruce voices delight over last-minute signing of Ahly's Fathi and Gedo in six-month loan deal
"It's fantastic to bring in two international footballers for the rest of the season," Bruce said at a Friday press conference.
Ahly's midfield duo finalised six-moth loan deals to join the English championship side only one day before the close of the winter transfer window.
"Gedo has a really good scoring record and is fantastic on the international level. He plays off both feet and could be a big asset to us," Bruce said.
"As for Fathi, he can play anywhere: right-back, centre-back, defensive midfield… he has versatility," Bruce added.
The two new loan signings, however, are not set to arrive in Hull until next week.
The club's Egyptian chairman, Assem Allam, is trying to boost the team's squad with a view to clinching a promotion to the Premier League at the end of the season.
Egypt winger Ahmed Elmohamady also returned to the Hull City squad ahead of Saturday's trip to Millwall after Sunderland allowed him to complete his loan spell with the Championship side.
"I've got to thank Martin O'Neill for letting Ahmed come back here," Bruce said. "With the way we play, he's a key player who makes the wing-back position look very easy."
"The ability to run up and down the wing is an art and the position suits him," he added. "We're delighted to have him back."
Hull City are now third in the table with 50 points, ten behind leaders Cardiff City.
