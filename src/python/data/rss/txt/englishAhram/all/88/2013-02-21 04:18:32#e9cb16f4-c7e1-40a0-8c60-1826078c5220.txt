Ayman Nour 'ready to head the government if Morsi asks'
Ghad El-Thawra founder said he is ready to head the government if he is asked but that might not be necessary, at least yet
Ayman Nour, founder of the liberal Ghad El-Thawra party, has said that he is engaged in dialogue with President Morsi and is prepared to take up a leadership position if invited to do so by the president.
Nour said in an interview with Ahram Arabic newspaper that he is the only person from the opposition bloc the National Salvation Front (NSF) who has participated in the national dialogue called for by President Mohamed Morsi.
The NSF has demanded the resignation of the cabinet and prosecutor-general, and the amendment of a Shura-proposed elections law, before it agrees to participate in the national dialogue process.
Nour, who met with the president last week, said that he is ready to head the government if he were asked to.
"If I was called to this national mission to rescue our country, I would never hesitate," he said.
Speaking about the current cabinet, he commented: "We appreciate their efforts; however, it was much lower than what we expected from the first government."
Nour further said that it was too early to discuss any nominations for a new government.
The Ghad El-Thawra founder said that he holds the presidential institution, the Muslim Brotherhood, and the Freedom and Justice Party accountable for the government's poor performance.
Nour also stated that opposition forces are not united, and called for a cohesive national dialogue. 
President Morsi called for a new round of national dialogue with the opposition during a speech on 28 January.
Members of the National Salvation Front have thus far rejected any dialogue with the president without "guarantees."
