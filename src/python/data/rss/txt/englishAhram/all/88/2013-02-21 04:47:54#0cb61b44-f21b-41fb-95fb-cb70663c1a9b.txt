Police absence delays Zamalek game in Egyptian league
Egyptian Premier League round four Group B match between Petrojet and Zamalek is threatened with cancellation for absence of security Thursday.
The two teams and the referees arrived early in Dar El-Defaa stadium but a no show by the police or the military forced the referee to delay kick-off set for 2:30pm.
“The Interior Ministry informed the Egyptian Football Association (EFA) a week ago that the police will only secure Cairo-based matches but not the Suez match that was moved to Cairo,” Interior Ministry operations manager Hisham Disouky told an Egypt TV programme.
All Suez matches are supposed to be held in Cairo due to security concerns.
The Egyptian Football Association announced to local Egyptian television that they are “contacting the military forces” to save the match.
The Egyptian Premier League was suspended for a year in the wake of Port Said stadium tragedy that left more than 70 Ahly football club fans dead after clashing with rivals Masry.
In a new two-group league format, the winners of the two groups will advance to play a mini-league with only home fixtures to determine the champion. The competition is being played behind closed doors at military-owned stadiums due to security concerns.
