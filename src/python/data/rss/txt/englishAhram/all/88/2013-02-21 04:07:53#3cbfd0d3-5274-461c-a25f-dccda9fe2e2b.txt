Barcelona coach confident of Champions League qualification
Assistant Barcelona coach Jordi Roura says team will qualify for UEFA Champions League quarterfinals
Barcelona are scheduled to face Milan in the second leg of the 16th round of the Champions League on 12 March. The first leg result was a 2-0 win for the Italian giants.
"It's a bad result but we're convinced that we'll make it through to the next round in Barcelona," Roura was quoted as saying on Barcelona's official website.
"Milan played their game. They had a lot of men on defence; they were organised and had the right attitude. We lacked fluidity and depth," he added.
The 45-year-old tactician has expressed his complete confidence in his team regarding their upcoming match with AC Milan in the second leg in which they hope to qualify for the quarterfinals.
"We’re convinced that we’ll make it through to the next round in Barcelona," he said. "We’re playing at home; the people will support us and the pitch will be in optimal condition."
Camp Nou players also expressed confidence in their ability to defeat Milan and go through to the coming round in Spain.
"We are Football Club Barcelona and we have to fight back," Barcelona defender Gerard Piqué said.
Barcelona's Dani Alves also confirmed that his team didn't play well in the first leg, but promised to do their best in the home game next March.
"We have to be better competitors. We didn't play a good game. We didn’t create goal-scoring chances and that's what you have to do to win," Alves said.
"It's not that we played terribly after the first goal. We didn’t play well in general and that’s largely due to how well our rival played. We have to improve," Alves concluded.
