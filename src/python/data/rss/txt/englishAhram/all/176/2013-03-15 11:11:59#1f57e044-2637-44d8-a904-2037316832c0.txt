Egypt's ENPPI close on Confederation Cup round of 16 with comfortable win
Egyptian side ENPPI crush Kenya's Gor Mahia 3-0 in the first leg of the Confederation Cup round of 32
Egyptian side ENPPI closed in on a last-16 place at the CAF Confederation Cup after thrashing Kenya's Gor Mahia 3-0 in Cairo on Friday.
Ivorian striker Vincent Die Foneye put the hosts ahead after 30 minutes after making the most of a cross from forward Ahmed Omran.
Omran turned from provider to scorer four minutes before the break to double ENPPI's lead and striker Ahmed Raouf completed the rout on 85 minutes.
ENPPI, who squandered some clear-cut chances which could have given them a more comprehensive win, face Gor Mahia in the second leg of the Confederation Cup round of 32 in a fortnight.
Africa's secondary club competition has eluded Egyptian clubs since it was introduced in 2004 by merging the African Cup Winners' Cup and the CAF Cup in a single competition.
