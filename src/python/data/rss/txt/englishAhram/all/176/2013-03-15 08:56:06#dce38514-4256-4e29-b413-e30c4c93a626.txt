Egyptian journalists have elected Diaa Rashwan as the new head of Cairo's Journalists Syndicate on Friday.
Rashwan garnered 1280 votes to 1015 for challenger Abdel Mohsen Salama. The elections were held in the Journalists Syndicate in Cairo and its branch in Alexandria on Friday.
The frontrunners for the title were Salama, the writer and managing editor of Al-Ahram Arabic daily newspaper, and Diaa Rashwan, the famous political analyst and head of Al-Ahram Centre for Political and Strategic Studies (ACPSS).
Political analyst Diaa Rashwan, born in 1960, is known for his political studies and analysis on Islamist groups in Egypt and the Arab world. A graduate of faculty of economics and political sciences at Cairo University, Rashwan joined ACPSS in 1981; in 2011, he was appointed as head of the centre.
Diaa Rashwan ran for the Journalists Syndicate head position in 2009, but failed. He also ran for the parliamentary elections in 2010, but was not elected.
Rashwan is the second head of Journalists Syndicate to be choosen after Egypt's 25 January Revolution. In 2011, Egyptian journalists elected Mamdouh El-Wali as the head of the syndicate.
