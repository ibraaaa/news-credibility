Egypt's Morsi: Those who incite violence through media will be punished
President Morsi declares that anyone found using the media to incite violence 'will not escape punishment,' stresses his right to impose exceptional measures to restore order
Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi on Sunday evening threatened to expose "the inciters and supporters" of violence and thuggery as "those who are sabotaging" the course of the January 25 Revolution and Egypt's democratic transition.
Morsi made the statements at the opening session of a conference devoted to women's rights and freedoms at the presidential palace in Cairo.
"I could stop these inciters of violence, but I'm capable of holding them accountable through law," Morsi said, adding that alleged provocateurs – who he did not refer to by name – were using the media to incite violence and chaos in Egypt.
"Whoever is found to be involved in promoting violence through the media will not escape punishment," the president warned.
He went on to indirectly accuse officials of the former regime who were recently acquitted of corruption charges of standing behind recent political violence.
"Those who were acquitted may want to sow chaos in Egypt," he said. "We respect the judiciary's rulings, but if those [acquitted] are promoting chaos, we will bring them to justice."
Morsi went on to stress his "right to impose exceptional measures to restore domestic order."
Morsi added that any attempt to "portray the Egyptian State as weak" would be destined to fail.
Earlier on Sunday, via Twitter, the presidency warned Egyptian opposition parties and groups against "providing political cover for violence."
