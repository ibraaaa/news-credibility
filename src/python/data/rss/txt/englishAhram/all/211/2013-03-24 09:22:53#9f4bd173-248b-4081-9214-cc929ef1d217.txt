Zimbabwe coach expects tough mission against Egypt
Zimbabwe coach admits to the difficulty of his team's World Cup qualifier against seven-time African champions Egypt on Tuesday
Zimbabwe coach Claus Dieter Pagels said he needs "a fighting spirit" from his players if they are to cause any upset in a difficult World Cup qualifier against Egypt in Alexandria.
Group G leaders Egypt, who garnered maximum six points from two games, host Zimbabwe, who lie at the bottom of the group, on Tuesday at an army-owned stadium in Alexandria.
The Pharaohs warmed up for the game with a 10-0 hammering of tiny Swaziland in a friendly game on Friday.
“I know they are a very strong team and that we are facing a tough mission in Alexandria”, Pagels was quoted as saying by CAF online on Sunday.
“I watched their recent friendly games and know they are a very good team despite the fact that they lost in some of the recent matches. I also watched some DVD’s of their old games and know well what awaits us on Tuesday”, he added.
The German coach criticized the Zimbabwe football association for the team's inadequate preparations for the Egypt clash.
“I asked Zimbabwe Football Association to arrange some friendly games for us, and to leave for Egypt early but the financial situation couldn’t sustain that," he said.
'' We didn’t have enough time to prepare for such a crucial game, but we’ll do our best and try to have a positive result. The mission needs a strong mentality and fighting spirit from my boys."
