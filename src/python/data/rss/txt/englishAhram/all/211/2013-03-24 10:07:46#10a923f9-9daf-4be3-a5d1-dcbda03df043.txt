Egypt's Morsi in Qatar Monday for Arab League Summit
President Morsi will make first-ever state visit to Doha on Monday to attend Arab League Summit and hold talks with Qatari Emir Sheikh Hamad Ben Khalifa Al-Thani
Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi will arrive in Doha on Monday evening to attend an annual Arab League Summit slated for the following day.
Morsi will deliver Egypt's opening speech at the event, after which he is expected to hold talks with Qatari Emir Sheikh Hamad Ben Khalifa Al-Thani.
During his two-day visit, Morsi will also meet with officials of the Egyptian-Qatari Business Council and members of the Egyptian expatriate community in Doha.
The Syrian crisis and the Palestinian issue are expected to top the summit's agenda, along with Arab economic integration and Arab League reform.
The visit will be Morsi's first to the tiny oil-rich emirate. Last October, he met with the Qatari emir in Cairo.
