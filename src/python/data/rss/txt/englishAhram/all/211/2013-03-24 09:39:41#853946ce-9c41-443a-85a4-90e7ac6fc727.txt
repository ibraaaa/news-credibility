Nigeria tie is a must win, says Egypt U-20 coach
Egypt's U-20 side not resting on their laurels despite booking their place at the World Cup as they face Nigeria in the African Championship semis on Tuesday
Egypt are determined to beat Nigeria in Tuesday's clash in the semi-final of the U-20 African Championship despite fulfilling their ultimate target - qualifying for the World Cup.
The young Pharaohs had reached the World Cup, which will take place in Turkey in the summer, after finishing on top of Group A of the African Championship with maximum nine points.
"The Nigeria clash will be different than our games in the group stage as we will have no chances to recover if we lose in the semis. It is a must win situation because otherwise we will exit the tournament," Egypt coach Rabie Yassin was quoted as saying by Ahram Sport on Sunday.
"The return of suspended players will be a great boost for us as we will play the match with full strength.
"We studied our opponents well and we know everything about them. We will prepare the best strategy to overcome them and reach the final," the coach added.
Nigeria finished second in Group B with six points from three games, behind leaders Mali. The four semi-finalists reached the World Cup.
