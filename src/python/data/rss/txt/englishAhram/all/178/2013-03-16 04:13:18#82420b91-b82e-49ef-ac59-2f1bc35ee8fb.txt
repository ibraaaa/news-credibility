Al-Nasr to offload Egypt's midfielder Abd-Rabou: report
Abd-Rabou's honeymoon with Saudi side Al-Nasr might be coming to an end
Saudi club Al-Nasr will not extend the stay of Egypt's midfielder Hosni Abd-Rabou beyond the end of the season, Saudi reports said on Saturday.
The 28-year-old, who had a previous Saudi stint with Jeddah-based club Ittihad, joined Al-Nasr last summer on a season-long loan deal from Egypt's Ismaily.
According to local reports, Al-Nasr coach Daniel Carreno told the club's management he no longer needs the player, citing his recent injuries as the main reason for his decision.
Abd-Rabou, who was called up by Egypt for the World Cup qualifier against Zimbabwe on 26 March, also faces a hefty fine after departing to Cairo without the club permission.
Saudi daily newspaper Alriyadh said on Saturday that the player was supposed to leave on Tuesday to join up with the Pharaohs ahead of their third World Cup qualifier.
