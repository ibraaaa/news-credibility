Meteb ends goal drought to give Ahly Champions League win in Kenya
Two second-half goals put title holders Ahly on the verge of a last-16 place at the African Champions League following a 2-1 victory at Kenya's Tusker
Substitute Emad Meteb ended his lengthy goal drought in style, scoring two second-half goals to give title holders Ahly a 2-1 victory at Kenya's Tusker in the first leg of the African Champions League round of 32 on Saturday.
The misfiring striker, who has not scored for around eight months and is playing a bit-part role in the Egyptian Premier League this season, broke the deadlock three minutes after the restart following an uninspiring first half.
He added the second shortly after with a fine header before Tusker's Peter Opiyo scored a consolation.
Ahly, who won a record-extending seventh Champions League title last year, should secure easy passage to the last 16 when they host Tusker in the second leg in a fortnight.  
Chances were at a premium in a dull first half that only yielded some tame efforts from both sides.
The hosts had a sole half-chance when a mis-hit volley by Joseph Shikokoti went over the bar after 25 minutes while Ahly failed to muster a single shot on target.
The match breathed into life in a more exciting second half as Meteb, who replaced ineffective striker El-Sayed Hamdy, opened the scoring in the 48th minute.
He connected with a low cross from Abdallah El-Said to send a weak shot that squirmed beneath Tusker keeper and into the net.
The 30-year-old, who was overlooked by Egypt for the upcoming World Cup qualifier against Zimbabwe, added the second nine minutes later when he headed home a pinpoint cross from veteran midfielder Mohamed Barakat.
Tusker pulled one back via a far-post header from Opiyo in the 59th minute but Ahly held firm to secure a valuable away win.
