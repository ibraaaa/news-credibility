Everton leave Man City's title hopes in tatters
Everton beat Man City 2-0 in the 30th matchday of the English Premier League on Saturday
Manchester City's finger-tip hold on their Premier League title was loosened further with a 2-0 defeat at Everton on Saturday.
Leon Osman's swerving 32nd-minute shot put Everton in front at Goodison Park and even though they were reduced to 10 men when Steven Pienaar was red-carded on the hour mark City could not reply.
Substitute Nikica Jelavic sealed victory deep into stoppage time on the counter-attack after being set up by Marouane Fellaini.
Leaders Manchester United can take full advantage of City's fourth league defeat of the season when victory over joint-bottom Reading later on Saturday would put them 15 points clear.
A week after being booed and heckled by their own fans in a 3-0 FA Cup defeat by Wigan Athletic, Everton produced a gutsy performance to remain in contention for a top-four finish.
Victory lifted them into fifth place, a point above Arsenal who are away at Swansea City (1500) and four behind fourth-placed Chelsea.
