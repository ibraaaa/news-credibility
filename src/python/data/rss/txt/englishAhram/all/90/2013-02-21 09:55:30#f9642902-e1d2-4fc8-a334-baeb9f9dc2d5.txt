Egyptian striker Mido denies Inter talks
Former Zamalek striker Ahmed Hossam 'Mido' denies media reports on him possibly moving to Italian giant Inter Milan
Egyptian striker Ahmed Hossam 'Mido' has denied media reports which suggested that he would join Serie A giant Inter Milan.
Inter are looking for a new striker after Diego Milito's injury which will sideline him for the rest of the season and part of the next one.
Given the winter transfer window was closed at the start of this month the Italian club have to search a free agent to sign him and Mido, who ended his contract amicably with championship side Barnsley, was reportedly linked with a possible move to Inter.
"There are no negotiations between me and Inter," the former Zamalek striker said on a TV program on Thursday.
"If it happens, it will be a surprise given I am out of action for a long time." he added.
Former Zamalek, Ajax, Marseille, Roma and Tottenham, Mido had signed a one-year-contract with championship side Barnsley last summer but he was released by mutual consent, six months later.
