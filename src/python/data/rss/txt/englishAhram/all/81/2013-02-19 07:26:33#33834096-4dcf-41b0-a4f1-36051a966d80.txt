Egypt stocks tumble on Port Said unrest
EGX30, EGX70 fall by 1.19%, 1.64% respectively as 'civil disobedience' campaign in the canal city enters third day
Egypt's bourse fell Tuesday in line with experts' predictions that the recent wave of unrest to hit Egyptian canal city Port Said would send the stock market into a downturn.
Mass protests continued in Port Said for the third day in a row on Tuesday, closing schools and the city's duty-free zone, which is home to at least 29 factories. The wave of unrest is being described by organisers as a campaign of 'civil disobedience.'
The Suez Canal Authority has said that navigation through the canal was normal, despite events in Port Said.
Egypt's benchmark EGX30 index fell by 1.19 percent to 5,623 points on Tuesday, as the broader-based EGX70 declined by 1.64 percent.
Out of 176 stocks traded, 146 suffered losses while only 12 registered gains. Blue-chip stocks Orascom Construction Industries (OCI) and Commercial International Bank (CIB) both tumbled, by 0.42 percent and 2.41 percent respectively.
"Stock market performance was very poor today; investors were probably discouraged by the state of unrest in the canal cities," Ashraf Abdel-Aziz, head of institutional sales at Cairo-based brokerage Arabeya Online, said.
Trade volume, meanwhile, remained low, registering only some LE438 million, illustrating investors' wariness regarding the current state of unrest in and around Port Said.
Egyptian and Arab investors were net buyers for the day, picking up almost LE4 million and LE11 million respectively. Foreign investors, meanwhile, were net sellers, offloading some LE15 million in shares.
