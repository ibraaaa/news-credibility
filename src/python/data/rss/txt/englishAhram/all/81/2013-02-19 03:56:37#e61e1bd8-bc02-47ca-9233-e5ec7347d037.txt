TV channels accused of illegally showing Egyptian films
Officials believe that 15 television channels are pirating Egyptian movies
In an interview with MENA published on Tuesday, director of the chamber Sayed Fathi said: "We are currently looking at measures to be taken against those channels and are trying to find an effective way to react​​."
"Legal action which will be taken, in addition to initiating dialogue with these channels. We will exhaust all available methods," he said, asserting that all Egyptian films are currently being pirated.
Fathi confirms that the identity of the monitored channels remains unknown to authorities, however, "they appear to be of Egyptian sources but current investigations will reveal details in the near future."
Fathi points out that during the International Federation of Producers summit in Paris which took place earlier this month, the subject of piracy of Egyptian films was on the agenda, upon request of the Egyptian chamber.
Accordingly, decisions in regard to stopping the crime were taken last week during the general meeting of the Board of Directors of the chamber in Egypt last week.
