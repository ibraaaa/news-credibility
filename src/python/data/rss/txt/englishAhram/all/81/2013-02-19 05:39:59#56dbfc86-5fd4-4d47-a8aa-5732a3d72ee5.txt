Egypt's President Morsi invited to inaugurate March tourism conference
Three-day conference aims to brainstorm means of reactivating post-revolution Egypt's battered tourism industry
Egypt's Coalition to Support Tourism (CST) has invited President Mohamed Morsi to open an upcoming three-day conference – from 11 to 13 March – devoted to tourism promotion, according to CST head Ehab Moussa.
According to Moussa, the conference aims to tackle the main obstacles currently faced by Egypt's tourism industry and discuss possible solutions to the months-long crisis that continues to grip the sector.
Reactivating Egypt's tourism industry, Moussa asserted, represented the only way out of Egypt's current political and economic impasse.
The first day of the conference will be dedicated entirely to reconciling the sector's main actors – i.e., chambers of tourism, public and private syndicates and professional coalitions – with one another.
On the second day, which will be attended by various political parties and cabinet ministers, issues pertaining to relations between the public and private sector will be addressed.
The final day of the event, which will be attended by foreign diplomats and international agencies, will aim at reaching agreement as to the best means of restoring Egypt as a viable destination for global tourism.
Egypt's tourism industry, historically one of the country's prime sources of foreign currency, has been hard hit by successive waves of political unrest since November of last year.
