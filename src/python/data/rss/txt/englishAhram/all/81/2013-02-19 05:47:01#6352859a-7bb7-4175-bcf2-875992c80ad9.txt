Valencia's Rami likely to miss PSG trip
French defender Adil Rami is doubtful for Valencia Champions League against Paris St Germain
Valencia centre back Adil Rami is almost certainly out of their Champions League last 16 second leg at Paris St Germain on March 6 after a scan showed he had damaged a muscle in his left leg, the La Liga club said on Tuesday.
"The player has begun treatment and the estimated recovery time is approximately three weeks," Valencia said in a statement on their website.
Valencia will miss Rami's solid presence in defence and he also scored the club's 90th-minute goal in last week's first leg, which finished 2-1 to PSG.
Victor Ruiz is likely to partner Ricardo Costa in central defence in Rami's absence.
