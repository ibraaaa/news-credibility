Qatar calls on Arabs to support Egypt economy
Qatari Emir Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani calls on Arabs to support 'Arab Spring' countries, especially Egypt, during speech at opening of Arab League summit
The emir of Qatar has called on Arab states to offer economic support to Egypt and other 'Arab Spring' countries.
"Nobody can forget the sacrifices Egypt has made for all the Arabs," Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani said during a speech at the Arab League summit in Doha on Tuesday.
Doha has granted Egypt $5 billion, including a $1 billion grant and $4 billion worth of deposits at the central bank, since the January 25 Revolution. Half of this sum was given in January following a severe devaluation of the Egyptian currency.
In September 2012 Qatar promised to invest $18 billion in Egypt over the next five years.
Various senior Qatari officials have visited Cairo in recent months, including Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani, Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs Sheikh Hamad bin Jassem, and the head of the intelligence service, Ahmed Nasser bin Jassem.
Egypt's relations with Qatar have strengthened since the revolution, especially after the Muslim Brotherhood's Mohamed Morsi was elected president.
In January, Qatar's Prime Minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim Al-Thani said his country did not want Egypt to go bankrupt.
