Coach El-Badry welcomes Egypt duo Zaki, Zidan in Ahly
The Pharaohs strikers duo could solve the problems of the Red Devils' attack line in the near future
Ahly coach Hossam Hossam El-Badry welcomes the idea of signing Egypt strikers Amr Zaki and Mohamed Zidan in summer to solve the club's striking crisis.
Ahly is suffering at the domestic level, especially in attack after loaning out their striking trio stars Mohamed Abou-Treika, Ahmed Fathi and Mohamed Nagy "Gedo" in the winter transfer window.
El-Badry was obliged to allow them to go because of the club's financial crisis and the uncertainty of the Egyptian league's future.
"We need to sign new players to boost our squad for the jammed schedule at both the domestic and continental level," El-Badry said after Sunday's friendly 4-1 win over Bahtim.
"I have no problem signing Zaki. Zidan also is a great addition, especially with his vast experience," he added.
The Pharaohs striking duo are currently out of action as Zidan was not officially registered in UAE's Bani Yas squad for the season's second term, while Zaki is club-less after terminating the contract with former club ENPPI amicably.
Former Zamalek hitman Zaki terminated his deal with Turkey's Elazigspor earlier in February after being with them for only five months. He returned to ENPPI but left them after few days.
Zidan joined Bani Yas in summer after spending 12 years in Europe playing for Borussia Dortmund and Mainz in the Bundesliga.
Ahly are looking to win an eighth-consecutive league title this season. They are also chasing a second successive Champions League accolade, having won a record-extending seventh title last year.
