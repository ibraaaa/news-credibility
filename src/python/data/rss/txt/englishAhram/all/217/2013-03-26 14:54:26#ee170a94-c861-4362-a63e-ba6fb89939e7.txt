LIVE: Egypt v Zimbabwe (World Cup qualifiers)
Pharaohs eye victory over Zimbabwe in Alexandria on Tuesday as part of their qualifying campaign for the 2014 World Cup
Stay tuned for Ahram Online's live update coverage of Egypt's match with Zimbabwe in the 2014 World Cup qualifiers.
Egypt will enjoy the support of their fans for the first time since the Port Said disaster in 2012. 
Alexandria's Borg El-Arab Stadium can hold up to 80,000 people but only 10,000 spectators will be allowed to attend the game.
The Pharaohs are two points clear of second-placed Guinea and four ahead of Mozambique, who played out a goalless draw on Sunday. Zimbabwe are bottom of the group with a solitary point from two games.
American coach Bob Bradley had previously vowed to secure Egypt's first ticket to the most prestigious global competition since 1990.
Egypt's probable starting line-up:
Abdel-Wahed El-Sayed, Ahmed Fathi, Wael Gomaa, Mohamed Naguib, Mohamed Abdel-Shafy, Hosni Abd-Rabou, Mohamed El-Neny, Mohamed Abou-Treika, Mohamed Salah, Mohamed Nagy 'Gedo', Ahmed Hassan Mekki
