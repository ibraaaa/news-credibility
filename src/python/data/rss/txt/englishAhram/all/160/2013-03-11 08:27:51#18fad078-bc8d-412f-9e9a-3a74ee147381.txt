Egypt's Abou-Treika remains out of action with Bani Yas
Bani Yas technical staff prefres to give the Pharaohs star more rest to prepare him for a strong return later this month
The Pharaohs starter suffers a hamstring injury that sidelined him in the Emirati club last three matches. Despite his recent return to the training sessions, it seems that he is not ready for action yet.
" Abou-Treika
will miss the team trip to Bahrain as the technical staff opted to let him get more rest to ensure his complete recovery ahead of Al-Nasr clash in the domestic league on 29 March," Bani Yas football director Saleh Ismail told UAE newspaper Emarat Al-Youm.
Despite the injury,
Abou-Treika
was called up alongside other 11 foreign-based Egyptian players for national training camp that starts on 17 March ahead of their match against Zimbabwe in the 2014 World Cup qualifiers on 26 March.
The 35-year old Egyptian star, who has joined Bani Yas this winter from Egyptian giants Ahly on loan until the end of the current season, has managed quickly to prove his worth in UAE as he scored twice in two appearances before being injured.
