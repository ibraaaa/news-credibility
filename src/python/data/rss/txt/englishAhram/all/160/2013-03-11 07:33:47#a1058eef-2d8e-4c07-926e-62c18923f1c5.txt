AC Milan's Muntari confident ahead of Barcelona's clash
AC Milan's midfielder believes his side would continue their campaign in UEFA Champions League at the expense of Barcelona
AC Milan's Ghanaian midfielder Sulley Muntari said on Monday his team is ready to overcome Barcelona in Tuesday's champions league clash (second leg) to continue their winning campaign in the continental competition.
The Rosenneri took a 2-0 fist leg advantage two weeks ago thanks to the Ghanaian duo Kevin-Prince Boateng and Sulley Muntari who scored Milan's goals.
But the Italian giants have to fight fiercely on Tuesday against Lionel Messi and his teammates to ensure their qualification to the next round.
"We beat them to their game in Italy and we will repeat our performance there (Spain)," Muntari said in a recent interview.
"We will make things difficult for them and prevent them from playing their fluid passing game. We know what Messi and Iniesta can do, for instance, but we will make things difficult for them."
The 28-year-old believed also that his side's 2-0 win over Genoa in Serie A on Friday, boosted the players' morale ahead of the Champions League clash.
"We will take inspiration from that and go there with confidence," he added.
