Zamalek's winger Emam fit for African encounter
Zamalek's winger Hazem Emam will be able to play with the White Knights on their upcoming clash against Vita Club in Champions League
Zamalek's doctor Moustapha El-Monayeri announced on Monday that winger Hazem Emam will be ready to play against Vita Club in Friday's round 32 champions league clash (first leg) after recovering from a muscle injury.
"Emam is fit to play and could participate in Friday's clash," El-Monayeri told Ahram Sports on Monday.
Emam, who sustained a hamstring injury during his team's training two weeks ago, has missed Zamalek's 3-1 win over El-Intag El-Harby in the Egyptian league on Friday.
In that game, the White Knights missed the efforts of their lively winger who solves various problems for the team.
Normally introduced as a second half substitute, Emam played a big role in Zamalek's victories helping them to lead their group in the Egyptian League, as he scored and made several assists in previous games.
Zamalek reached the Champions league round 32 following a 7-0 win on aggregate over Chad’s Gazelle.
