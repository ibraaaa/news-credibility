Art Alert: Mosireen to screen two independent short films
On Tuesday 19 March, media collective Mosireen will host a Cairo screening of 'Though I Know the River is Dry' by Omar Robert Hamilton and 'Bahari' by Ahmed El-Ghoneimy
After a long hiatus, Egyptian media collective Mosireen's Tuesday film screenings are back with a night showcasing two short films on Tuesday 19 March.
Omar Robert Hamilton, one of Mosireen's founders, will be showing his film 'Though I Know the River is Dry' in its debut Egyptian screening.
The short film tells the story of Alaa, a Palestinian man caught between the past and future.
'Though I Know the River is Dry' was crowdfunded through two online campaigns, following a similar campaign to that launched by Mosireen themselves to cover their expenses for the next two years. 
The film premiered at the International Film Festival Rotterdam in 2012 and is nominated by the festival for the Best Short Film award at the 2013 European Film Awards.
The other film, 'Bahari' (the name of an Alexandrian neighbourhood), directed by Alexandria-based director Ahmed El-Ghoneimy, tells the story of Amr as he wanders through the streets of Bahari filming children and getting into trouble with the locals and the authorities.
'Bahari' was produced during a workshop with director and video artist Sherif El-Azama and also premiered at the International Film Festival Rotterdam. It was awarded the Hamburg Short Film Award at the International Short Film Festival Hamburg. 
The film was screened in 2012 at El-Cabina in Alexandria as well as in Cairo during PhotoCairo 5 at Contemporary Image Collective.
