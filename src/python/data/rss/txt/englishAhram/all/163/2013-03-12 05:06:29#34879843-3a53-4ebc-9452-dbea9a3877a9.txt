Fans unlikely at Zamalek's CAF match in Alexandria
Egyptian interior ministry orders Zamalek to play African Champions League match against Vita Club in Alexandria due to security concerns; fans unlikely to be allowed to attend match
The match, in the last-32 of the CAF Champions League, will take place in Borg El-Arab stadium in the coastal city.
"We received a message from the interior ministry saying it would not be able to secure our CAF match in Cairo because of the current security situation," reads a statement on Zamalek's official website.
Security instability has dominated the country recently, especially since the verdict in the Port Said trial on 9 March. The Egyptian Football Association (EFA) headquarters and the Police Club in Cairo were torched by anonymous rioters after the verdict. Investigations into the incidents are ongoing.
Fans are unlikely to be allowed to attend the match due to security concerns, but Zamalek may contact the military authorities to request a small number of supporters be allowed to attend.
CAF threatened earlier to hold the match outside Egypt due to security concerns.
