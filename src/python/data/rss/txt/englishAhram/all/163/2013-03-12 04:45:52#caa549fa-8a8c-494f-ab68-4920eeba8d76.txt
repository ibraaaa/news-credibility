Barakat pledges future to Egypt's Ahly
The experienced midfielder is expected to put pen to paper with the African Champions League heroes soon
"Barakat will sign a new contract soon," Ahly football director Sayed Abdel-Hafiz was quoted as saying by the club's official website.
"The player was very flexible during the recent negotiations, as he pledged his future with the club without any conditions.
"The consequence of matches prevented us from settling the matter recently, but we will sort it after Sunday's match against Kenyan side Tusker," he added.
Ahly will kick off their defence of their African Champions League title against Kenyan side Tusker in the 32nd round of the CAF Champions League on Sunday.
Barakat will follow the steps of teammates left-back Sayed Moawad, Mohamed Abou-Treika and Wael Gomaa, who recently extended their stay at the club.
The 36-year old player, who joined Ahly in 2004 from Ahly Jeddah, guided the Red Devils to win African Champions League trophies in 2005, 2006 and 2008. He also contributed to guiding the team to seven Egyptian league titles.
Barakat announced his international retirement in 2009 after failing to reach the 2010 World Cup. He helped the Pharaohs win the African Cup of Nations in 2006, 2008 and 2010.
