Egypt's pope negotiates for release of Copts in Libyan jail
Pope Tawadros II of Egypt's Orthodox Church is meeting with the Libyan ambassador on Sunday afternoon to discuss the fate of four Egyptian Copts who remain in jail in Benighazi.
Sources told Ahram Online that the pope could ask Copts to end their siege of the Libyan embassy in Cairo if the Libyan authorities secure the release of the prisoners.
On Friday, the Libyan authorities released 55 copts it had accused of proselytising in the predominantly Muslim country.
Angry protesters have shut the Libyan mission in the Egyptian capital for several days.
