Ahly striker Meteb thanks supporters after Tusker win
Emad Meteb scores twice for Ahly defeating Tuskar of Kenya 2-1; the goals end 8-month goal drought for the player
Striker Emad Meteb was thankful for ending his goal drought, scoring twice in Ahly's African Champions League title match against Kenya's Tusker.
"I am thanking everyone who has supported me during previous hard times," the 30-year-old attacker said, adding, "I am really happy that I was able to score during this important game".
Meteb scored two goals for the Reds securing a 2-1 away victory in the first leg of the round of 32 Saturday after approximately eight months of goal-less striking.
"I also thank Mohamed Barakat [midfielder] to help me score," he said.
"My relationship with the coach [Hossam El-Badry] is well. It is based on mutual respect. I only wanted to rejoin the starting eleven to help my team more."
The Egyptian champions, who won a record-extending seventh Champions League title last year, should secure easy passage to the last 16 when they host Tusker in the second leg in a fortnight. 
Ahly's bitter rivals Zamalek defeated DR Congo's Vita Club 1-0 at home in the same round Friday.
