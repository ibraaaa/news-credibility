Maradona returns to Italy after 8-year tax exile
Diego Maradona has returned to Italy in a bid to clear his name in a tax evasion case.
The 1986 World Cup winner with Argentina landed Monday in Rome and headed straight to Naples, where he will hold a news conference Tuesday morning.
Maradona's Italian debts of more than $50 million stem from alleged unpaid taxes during the time he played for Napoli from 1984-91, a period in which he helped the club win its only two Serie A titles.
His lawyer, Angelo Pisani, recently said his client won the dispute. But the collection agency issued a statement earlier this month saying it had not ''annulled, declared extinct, nor modified'' Maradona's debts.
