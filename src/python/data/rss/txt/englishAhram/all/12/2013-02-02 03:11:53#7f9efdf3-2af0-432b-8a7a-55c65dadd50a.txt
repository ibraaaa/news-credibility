Maersk's troubled vessel berths safely in Egypt Suez Canal terminal
Giant container ship that faced mechanical problems near the Suez Canal is safely towed to berth
Emma Maersk, one of the world's largest container ships that found itself in trouble in Egyptian territorial waters, has been safely tugged to berth Saturday in Port Said East Suez Canal Container Terminal (SCCT), the Danish owned company has stated.
According to a Maersk statement, the 397-metre long vessel cancelled its southbound voyage through the Suez Canal en route to Asia after facing mechanical problems.
“She (the ship) is now alongside quay being discharged. Crew is safe. Situation is under control,” said the Facebook page of Maersk.
As the massive 171 ton vessel was towed away, Suez Canal traffic remained unaffected as ships continued to cross at scheduled times, an official at the canal told the state-run MENA news agency.
