Egypt's striker Zidan denies Bani Yas exit
The Pharaohs experienced hitman has no chance to sign for a new club this winter and denies that he has been taken off the team roster
Egypt and Bani Yas striker Mohamed Zidan denies claims that the UAE outfit will get rid of him this winter.
Recent reports said that the Pharaohs player, who was hit with a series of injuries this season, will not be registered in the club squad starting from January and will be replaced with another foreign player.
Zidan's exit rumours came about especially after the club's recent signing of country fellowman Mohamed Abou-Treika from Egypt's Ahly.
"The club management didn't inform me that I will be out of the club squad. They just told me that a new foreign player will join the club this winter," Zidan was quoted as saying by UAE's newspaper Albayan on Saturday.
"As a professional player, I am committed to my current contract with the club that runs for another season and a half. If the management decided to replace me with another player I will respect that.
"I will remain with Bani Yas until the end of my contract, since joining another club right now is difficult, especially after the close of the winter transfer window," the 30-year old attacker added.
Zidan joined the Bani Yas in summer after spending 12 years in Europe playing for Borussia Dortmund and Mainz in the Bundesliga.
The Egyptian forward, who was initially hit with a hamstring injury early this season, made some impressive performances after recovering, including scoring two goals. He was injured again during the 3-1 defeat against Al-Wasl in the UAE domestic league in December.
