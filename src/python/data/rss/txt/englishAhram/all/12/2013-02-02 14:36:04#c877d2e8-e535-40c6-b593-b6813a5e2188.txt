Troubled Maersk vessel risks blocking the Suez Canal
Water leakage puts monumental container ship, Emma Maersk, in trouble at the Northern entrance of Egypt's Suez Canal
Emma Maersk, one of the world's largest container ships, is currently facing mechanical problems at the northern entrance of the Suez Canal after water leaked inside its engines room, putting the ship at the risk of drowning, an official in the Suez Canal Authority told Ahram Online.
The 397-meter long vessel is owned by Denmark's Maersk Line, the world's largest container shipping company. Suez Canal tugboats are currently attempting to move the ship towards the Mediterranean to avoid blocking the waterway should the ship sink.
The ship is now docked at the Suez Canal Container Terminal (SCCT) at the mouth of the Canal.
"The situation is largely under control and it is being handled swiftly to avoid complications," a Suez Canal official, who requested anonymity as he is not authorised to talk to media, said.
He added that the strategic water way is unlikely to be closed down, even if the ship sinks.
"The northern entrance of the canal is divided into two branches, and even if one of them is shutdown, the other can still be used," the official explained.
