Ghana's Muntari wary of Barcelona trip despite home win
Ghana and Milan midfielder believes 2-0 win over Barcelona in the first leg of the Champions League is not enough to be safe
Muntari popped up to seal an incredible 2-0 win, finishing off with a neat volley off the lob of Stephan El-Shaaraway to send the home fans wild after Kevin-Prince Boateng's shot put the hosts ahead before a sold-out crowd at the Estadio Guiseppe Meazza.
“We played as a team, we listened to our coach, he did a fantastic job in how he sent us on the pitch,” Muntari told reporters after the game.
“We were very disciplined and managed to close every angle down so they couldn’t penetrate us," he added.
"If you play without concentration against them, they harm you and they make you suffer."
The 28-year-old midfielder described his goal against Barcelona on Wednesday as the most important goal of his career, revealing the Camp Nou visit will be difficult for the Italian giants when they face Barcelona in the second leg on 12 March.
 “It was the most important goal of my career. It is a good lead, but the Camp Nou is not easy."
“You can have a 5-0 lead but it is not safe as Barcelona have amazing players," he said.
“We have two goals to our advantage and we will do our best to do well.”
