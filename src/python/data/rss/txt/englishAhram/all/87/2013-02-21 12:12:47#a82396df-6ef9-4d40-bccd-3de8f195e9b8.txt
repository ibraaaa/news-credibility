Interior ministry ready to compromise for traffic in Tahrir Square
General Hassan El-Berdisy offers to protect revolutionary youth and remove concrete walls around the iconic square in exchange for help to reopen area to traffic
General Hassan El-Berdisy, director of Cairo's Traffic administration, agreed to participate in a dialogue initiative with a delegation of revolutionary youth hoping to reopen traffic in Tahrir Square to the public for the first time since November.
The initiative was proposed Wednesday evening by the media anchor Amr El-Laithy on his TV program 90 minutes.
Shady El-Ghazaly Harb, co-founder of Revolutionary Youth Coalition and leading member in Constitution party, was also hosted in the TV show and agreed to the initative.
El-Bardisy said the interior ministry could offer the revolutionary youth protection and would remove the concrete barriers in the streets leading to the square.
A number of protesters have been holding a sit-in in Tahrir Square since 22 November when President Morsi's constitutional declaration rendered his decisions above judicial challenge and made the Islamist-dominated Shura Council and Constituent Assembly immune from dissolution by court order.
