CAF to visit Libya this month over 2017 hosting
The Confederation of African Football will visit Libya this month and decide by the end of the year if the troubled country is able to host the 2017 African Cup of Nations
Libya was initially given the 2013 edition, but it was moved to South Africa, which was originally granted hosting rights for 2017.
Libya has been violently unstable since Moammar Gadhafi was overthrown in 2011.
Secretary general Hicham El Amrani says on Thursday there were "five or six" countries interested in hosting the 2019 African Cup. A shortlist would be revealed later in 2013.
Morocco hosts in 2015.
