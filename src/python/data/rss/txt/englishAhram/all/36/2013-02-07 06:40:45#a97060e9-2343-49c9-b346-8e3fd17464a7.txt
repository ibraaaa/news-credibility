Classical music outreach programme launches in Cairo and Alexandria
Egyptian Contemporary Classical Music Outreach Programme (ECCMOP) aims to present classical music to a wider audience by organising concerts from February to May in Cairo and Alexandria
The programme will present a number of concerts reflecting its major mission which is expressed in bringing the contemporary music to the society.
The ECCMOP aims to provide a platform for concerts of classical music as well as organising lectures and seminars around the genre.
According to the ECCMOP's official press release, the programme wishes to "stimulate the Egyptian musical and cultural scenes through educating our society on modern and contemporary classical music and reaching out to prospective audience, musicians, and composers."
The programme will present eight concerts, two each consecutive month until the end of May. The works performed are composed by contemporary Egyptian composers such as: Ahmed Madkour, Amr Okba, Mohamed Saad Basha, Khaled Shokry, and Sherif Mohie as well as Western contemporary music composers.
Moreover, as announced by ECCMOP on 4 February, three young Egyptian composers – Bahaa El-Ansary, George Kolta and Shady Hanna - have been commissioned to write new works for the contemporary classical music ensemble. They are expected to provide an eight to ten minute long composition for a String Quartet or Piano Quintet. The commissioned works will be performed in Cairo and Alexandria at the end of May 2013.
All events taking place under the ECCMOP's umbrella will take place at the Museum of Egyptian Modern Art in Cairo, and at the Alexandria Atelier in Alexandria. Each concert will be preceded by a discussion session in which composers will talk about the various trends of the musical genre and different ways of comprehending and appreciating it.
The first concert is planned on 21 February and its details will be announced soon.
