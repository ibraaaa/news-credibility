A concert for trip-hop, electro, classical and Delta Nile music lovers!
The Egyptian Project's expert mix of Delta Nile music and modern sounds of trip-hop, electro and hip hop brought such a strong crowd that they are now doing an encore performance
Many were turned away, or were only able to sway with the music booming outside of the small concert hall at the French cultural centre in Mounira.
The interest? A heavy trip-hop beat overlaid by a live Egyptian singer's voice that reminds us of the nay. They call themselves The Egyptian Project.
The smile on many people's faces revealed their soulful reaction to the music that spoke to them: an Egyptian that loves both the traditions of their farm villages and at the same time quality electronic music, or a foreigner allured by the entirety of Egypt's tale.
The French cultural institute's website describes the concert as a collaboration between supporters of Egyptian tradition and a young French musician who mixes the sounds of the Nile Delta, the city of Cairo, the atmosphere of the trip-hop, electro, hip hop and classical music.
Tonight they play an encore, not-scheduled performance due to the success of the first night. The next concerts will be in Cairo Jazz Club and Alexandria.
