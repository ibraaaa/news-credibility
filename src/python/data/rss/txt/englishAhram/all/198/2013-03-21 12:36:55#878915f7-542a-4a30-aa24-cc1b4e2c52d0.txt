Pakistan refugee camp bombing kills 12: Officials
At least 12 Pakistanis were killed after a car exploded at a refugee camp on Thursday
The death toll from a car bomb at a refugee camp in northwest Pakistan on Thursday climbed to 12 and left more than 30 others wounded, officials said.
The bomb went off at the Jalozai refugee camp close to the city of Peshawar, which is home to people fleeing unrest in tribal districts bordering Afghanistan that are a stronghold of Taliban and Al Qaeda-linked militants.
"The death toll has risen to 12 and there are more than 30 others who were wounded," district police chief Mohammad Hussain told AFP.
Local administration official Ayaz Khan Mandokhel confirmed the casualties and said that the bomb was planted in a Suzuki Alto car.
