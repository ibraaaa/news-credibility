Eye on the revolution: Ali Khafaguie – the Muslim Brotherhood narrative
In this ten-part series, Ahram Online asks those who took part in the 25 January Revolution what they make of Egypt's current political situation two years after Mubarak's departure
At the early age of 14, Ali Khafaguie joined the Muslim Brotherhood, out of curiosity and fascination. Khafaguie dared to join the 25 January revolution before the organisation leadership gave its consent, and today, he is a leading figure with the Muslim Brotherhood youth. He believes that it is not impossible to restore the unity that brought the many different political forces together in Tahrir Square early in 2011.
