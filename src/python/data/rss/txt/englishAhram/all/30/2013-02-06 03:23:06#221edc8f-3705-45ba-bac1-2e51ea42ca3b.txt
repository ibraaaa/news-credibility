Moawad to boost Ahly in African Super Cup
After being on the sidelines for months, Ahly left back Sayed Moawad will return to action later this month, club doctor says
Ahly's injured left left-back Sayed Moawad is expected to be available for their anticipated African Super Cup clash against DR Congo's Leopards.
Moawad is currently finishing his rehabilitation programme and will be available for training within the coming few days," Ahly's doctor Ihab Aly was quoted as saying by the club's official website.
Ahly had a successful league start, beating Ghazl El-Mahallah on Saturday. They will take on Wadi Degla in the second match on Sunday.
"Moawad will not be ready yet for Wadi Degla, but he will be available for the African Super Cup clash," the club doctor added.
Moawad, 33, has been a key member of Ahly’s squad since joining in 2008 after ending a highly successful spell with bitter rivals Ismaily.
