UK's Swivel Theatre invites submissions for plays on Arab women, Arab Spring
Swivel Theatre Company invites would-be scriptwriters to submit one-act plays on role of women in 'Arab Spring'; selected play to be performed by London's White Bear Theatre this summer
Under the banner of 'Arab Women in the Arab Spring,' the UK's Swivel Theatre Company is calling on talented scriptwriters to submit one-act plays on Arab women and their roles in recent Arab revolutions and popular uprisings. The selected play will be performed by the company in June.
The deadline for submissions is 4 March. There are no entry fees.
The selected play will be promoted, along with the writer's name, on the company's website. It will then be performed in a four-week run this summer at London's White Bear Theatre.
The exact date for the play's debut will be announced following the selection next month.
According to company guidelines, entrants are free to write – in a 30-page manuscript – comedy, drama, satire or gritty realism tackling the role of women in the 'Arab Spring'. The company will help entrants with research and guidance until scripts are ready for submission. 
Interested parties should send submissions – before the 4 March deadline – to:
