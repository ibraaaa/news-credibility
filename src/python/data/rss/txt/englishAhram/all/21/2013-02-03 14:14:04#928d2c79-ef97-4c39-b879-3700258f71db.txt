'Last of Dictionary Men' exhibition to show in London in February, March
The multimedia exhibition, which will run in London's Mosaic Rooms in February and March, tells the story of a century-old settlement of Yemeni sailors in Britain's South Shields
London's Mosaic Rooms will hold a collective multimedia exhibition on a settlement of Yemeni sailors in England's South Shields over the course of one hundred years. Entitled 'Last of the Dictionary Men,' the exhibition will run from 1 February to 31 March.
The multimedia exhibition features interviews with and portraits of 14 Yemeni sailors, the last survivors of the first generation of Yemeni sailors who made South Shields their home. 'Last of The Dictionary Men' tells their story, which spans the British Colonial and Post-Colonial eras.
The exhibition also includes a number of portraits by prominent Egyptian photographer Youssef Nabil.
"South Shields has had a vibrant Arab connection stretching back to the 1890s," reads a press release for the show. "This exhibition also offers a timely exploration and understanding of the complexity of British-Arab identities."
Programme:
1 February to 31 March, Tuesdays through Saturdays, 11am-6pm
Mosaic Rooms, 226 Cromwell Road, London
