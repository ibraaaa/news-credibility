Egyptian prosecutors request names of officers from Friday's clashes
Prosecutors are investigating the stripping and beating of protester Hamada Saber on Friday during clashes at the presidential palace
The Egyptian prosecutor-general's office asked the interior ministry on Monday for the names of the officers and security personnel responsible for securing the presidential palace on Friday.
Protester Hamada Saber was stripped naked by police officers after a demonstration at the presidential palace on Friday turned violent, when a number of protesters and security forces clashed.
The violent incident, which was screened on several satellite channels, sent shockwaves through the country, and was denied by Saber, who claimed he was actually assaulted by protesters and that security forces came to his rescue.
On Sunday, Saber changed his testimony while speaking to prosecutors.
Judge Ibrahim Saleh, head of the Heliopolis prosecution branch, sent a letter on Monday to the interior minister's first assistant for Central Security – the division that deals with demonstrations – requesting the list as part of an investigation to find out the perpetrators of the brutal attack.
Saleh also sent a letter to the inspection division of the interior ministry, asking if an investigation into the beating of Hamada Saber has been launched and requesting a copy of the findings if so.
