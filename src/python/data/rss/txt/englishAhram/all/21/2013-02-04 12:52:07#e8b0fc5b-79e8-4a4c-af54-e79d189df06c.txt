Art Alert: Documentaries on Egypt's education system screen in Alexandria
Two documentaries exposing deficiencies in Egypt's education system will be screened in El-Cabina in Alexandria, followed by Q&A with filmmakers
El-Cabina is to host a screening of two short films produced in 2010 by up-and-coming filmmakers Shereen Talaat and Chakir Lakhlifi, addressing the abysmal state of Egypt’s education system, with particular focus on violence and abuse in the classroom.
The documentary entitled
Ordinary Day
by Chakir Lakhlifi voices the students' frustrations over the violence they experience in the classroom at the hands of their teachers.
Conversely, in
ABC
, directed by Shereen Talaat, the spotlight is focused on the teacher's distress in the education system.
Screened consecutively, the documentaries provide a multi-dimensional insight into the problems pervading the education framework in Egypt, showcasing for the audience both the plights of students and teachers.
Last month, the two documentaries were screened at Cairo’s Messaha Foundation for Community Development. On Tuesday 5 February, the short docudramas will be screened at El-Cabina cultural centre, one of the Alexandria-based Gudran Association for Art and Development's projects, which pursues social development through supporting local arts and culture.
The screening will be followed by a Q&A session and a discussion with filmmakers Shereen Talaat and Chakir Lakhlifi.
