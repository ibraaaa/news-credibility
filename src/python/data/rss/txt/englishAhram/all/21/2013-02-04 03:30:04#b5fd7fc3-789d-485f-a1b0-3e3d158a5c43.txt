Egypt's prosecutor-general orders investigation into stripping-torture case
Case of Hamada Saber, who was stripped naked and beaten by Egyptian security forces on camera, will be investigated by prosecution
Prosecutor-general Talaat Abdullah commissioned on Monday a north Cairo court judge to continue investigations into the case of Hamada Saber, who was beaten and dragged naked by police officers last Friday during protests that turned violent at the presidential palace in Cairo.
During anti-government protests outside the presidential palace on Friday evening, a group of police from Egypt's Central Security Forces (CSF) were filmed stripping, beating and dragging Saber's prone body. The footage, aired by Egypt's Al-Hayat satellite channel, provoked outrage among certain quarters.
The violent incident screened on several satellite channels, which has sent shockwaves across the country, and was denied by Saber, who claimed he was actually assaulted by protesters and that security forces came to his rescue.
On Sunday, he changed his testimony while speaking to prosecutors.
Abdullah allowed a delegation from the freedoms' committee of the lawyers syndicate on Monday to visit Saber in hospital, to listen to his account. Saber later left the hospital and returned home.
