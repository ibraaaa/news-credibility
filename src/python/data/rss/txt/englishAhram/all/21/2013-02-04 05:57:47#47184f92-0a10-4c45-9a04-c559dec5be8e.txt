Ahly midfielder Shehabeddin doubtful for Degla game
Key Ahly midfielder Shehabeddin Ahmed may be out because of a muscle injury
"Medical scans have showed that Shehabeddin is suffering from a muscle injury," read a statement on Ahly's official website on Monday.
"The injury may sideline the midfielder in the coming game against Wadi Degla next Sunday."
