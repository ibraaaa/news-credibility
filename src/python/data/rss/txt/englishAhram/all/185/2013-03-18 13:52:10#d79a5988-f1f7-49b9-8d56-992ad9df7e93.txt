Ismaily coach praises players after Madagascar's Terrible win
Ismaily coach asks to think about the domestic league games and forget the CAF Confederation Cup win over Madagascar's Terrible
Ismaily coach Sabri Al Menyawi admired the players' performance during the 2-0 win over Terrible CO of Madagascar in the first leg of the African Confederation Cup round of 32.
Egypt's Ismaily needed two late goals to break down a resilient Terrible CO side, and achieved it beating the Madagascar club 2-0 in Alexandria on Sunday.
"The players were responsible during the game as they managed to seal the victory over Terrible in the last minutes of the game," Menyawi was quoted as saying on the club's official website.
"The second halftime substitutes made changes in the team's performance," he added.
The Dervishes scored in a three-minute second-half spell to ensure they would head into the second leg in a fortnight as favourites to reach the last 16 of Africa's secondary club competition.
The Confederation Cup has eluded Egyptian clubs since it was introduced in 2004 by merging the African Cup Winners' Cup and the CAF Cup in a single competition.
Ismaily are scheduled to face El-Entag El-Harby in the 9th matchday of the Egyptian premier league on Thursday.
"I ask the players to concentrate on the game against El-Entag El-Harby in the premier league and forget the African win." The tactician concluded.
