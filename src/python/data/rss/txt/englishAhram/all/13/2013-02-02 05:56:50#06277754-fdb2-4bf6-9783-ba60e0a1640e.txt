Funeral march heads towards Egypt's presidential palace
The funeral march for a young man shot in clashes between civilians and security on Friday starts heading towards the presidential palace - the site where he was shot
The funeral march for Mohamed Hussein Korani, who was killed in Friday's clashes, is leaving from the nearby Al-Nour mosque to the presidential palace.
According to hospital officials, Korani, a twenty-something man affectionately nicknamed Kresty, sustained gunshot wounds to the neck and chest.
"He was shot from a close distance. The bullets will be sent to prosecution with a final medical report," Emad Abdullah El-Dib, deputy head of forensic medicine told Al Ahram Arabic news website.
Hussein Korani was shot during the clashes that erupted late Friday at the presidential palace in Heliopolis, a suburb in northeast Cairo.
Demonstrations had begun peacefully as thousands marched towards the palace demanding amendments to the recently-approved constitution, dismissal of Prime Minister Hisham Qandil's cabinet and the appointment of a new prosecutor-general.
Some civilians threw Molotov cocktails at the palace, causing a minor fire in the palace garden.
In response, Central Security Forces fired tear gas as a
