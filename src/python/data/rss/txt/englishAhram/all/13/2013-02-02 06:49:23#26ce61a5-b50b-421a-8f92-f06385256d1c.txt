Presidency condemns filmed incident of stripped protester
Egyptian presidency asserts in press release that state policy is to prohibit torture, warning against attempts to capitalise on regretful incidents of violations
"The presidency was pained by the shocking footage of policemen dragging a protester in a way inconsistent with dignity and human rights," the statement reads.
The presidency statement further underlined that it "works 
on enforcing constitutional articles that prohibit torture, intimidation or harming individuals physically or psychologically."
The statement praised the Ministry of Interior statement assuring that the incident, which has caused public uproar, is an isolated incident that does not represent police policies and that an investigation has been ordered into the case.
The presidency added, however, that "it is unacceptable to capitalise on individual acts denounced by everybody to justify violence and criminal acts of attacking institutions."
"We are awaiting the outcome of the probe, which should be announced with transparency in accordance with January 25 Revolution goals," the statement added.
