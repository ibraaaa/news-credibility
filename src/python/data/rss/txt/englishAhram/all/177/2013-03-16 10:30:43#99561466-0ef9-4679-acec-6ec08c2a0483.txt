Tense calm in Egypt's Tanta after evening clashes
The Nile Delta city of Tanta saw clashes between police and dozens of anti-government protesters Friday evening
After clashes between anti-government protesters and police lasting hours Friday evening, calm returned to the Nile Delta city of Tanta Saturday morning.
Dozens of anti-government protesters blocked a main road and besieged the city's security directorate, as well as the governor's office, Friday evening. Police forces fired rounds of teargas intermittently as clashes lasted about four hours.
Egypt has seen a spate of violent anti-government protests since the second anniversary of the 25 January 2011 uprising.
