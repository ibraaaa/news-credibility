'Professional Syndicates Union' to be launched Saturday
New union to increase collaboration between member syndicates
Ahmed Lotfy, the Doctors' Syndicate media committee reporter, said that the participants are expected to meet on Saturday in the Engineers Syndicate to announce their official launch and elect the union's executive board. They will also announce the union's internal regulations.
Lotfy said that the union aims to increase collaboration between the different syndicates and offer joint services to its members.
The participating syndicates include the Doctors', the Pharmacists', the Physiotherapists', the Dentists', the Veterinarians', the Teachers', the Farmers', the Engineers', the Lawyers', and the Applied Art Designers', among others.
Egypt has 24 professional syndicates. In March 2011, former Minister for Manpower and Migration, Ahmed El-Boraei, announced new legislation whereby Egyptian workers for the first time could form unions and federations independent of the government.
However, even though the Egyptian Federation for Independent Trade Unions was launched, El-Boraei's proposed law has not yet been officially approved.
