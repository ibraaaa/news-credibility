Zamalek vows to overcome mistakes ahead of DR Congo trip
The Cairo giants will be hosted by DR Congo's Vita Club in the second leg of African Champions League round of 32 on 7 April
Zamalek's technique coaches are not satisfied with Friday's win over DR Congo's Vita Club in the African Champions League round of 32 and vow to overcome the weaknesses ahead of the return leg next month.
The Whites claimed a narrow 1-0 victory over their Kenyan hosts to get a step closer to the tournament's next round, but they still have to prove their worth in the second leg in DR Congo on 7 April.
"We have decided to forget the African tournament and concentrate only on the domestic league until the second leg next month," Zamalek assistant coach Osama Nabih was quoted as saying by the club's official website after the match.
"Vita Club was not an easy opponent and its players were the best physically. Winning by only one goal is not a sufficient result, but we are confident of our players' ability to win in DR Congo.
"The technique staff will focus on avoiding the mistakes that we did in the first leg to complete our African campaign successfully," the coach added.
The Cairo giants are bidding to win Africa's elite club competition for the first time since 2002. They are delivering outstanding performances in the Egyptian Premiere league this season as they are topping Group B with 18 points after 6 matches.
