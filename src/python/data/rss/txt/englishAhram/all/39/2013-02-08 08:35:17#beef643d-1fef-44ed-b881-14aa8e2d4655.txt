Tennis: Li Na pulls out of Qatar Open with ankle injury
Li Na out of Qatar Open after sustaining an ankle injury
Li Na has pulled out of next week's Qatar Open because of the ankle injury she sustained in the Australia Open final.
Qatar organizers say Timea Babos will replace Li in the main draw.
Li injured her left ankle during her three-set loss to Victoria Azarenka for the Australian Open title.
Venus Williams withdrew from the Qatar tournament earlier this week, citing back trouble. She was bothered by back issues in Melbourne.
The Qatar field still features nine of the top 10 players in the women's rankings.
