Thousands demonstrate in Tanta in front of home of activist Mohamed El-Gendy, allegedly killed by police torture
Thousands of people held a demonstration on Friday in Tanta, the capital of Gharbiya governorate, in front of the home of 28-year-old activist Mohamed El-Gendy, killed last week reportedly as a result of police torture during detention.
"Interior ministry members are thugs under both Mubarak and Morsi," chanted the protesters, who also called for retribution for the killing, reported Al-Ahram Arabic website
El-Gendy, 28, a member of the Popular Current, died in hospital on Monday after being transferred to the intensive care unit suffering from low blood pressure, a suspected brain haemorrhage and a brain effusion according to health ministry spokesperson Ahmed Omar.
Friends and family said that El-Gendy died after he was tortured in police custody following his arrest at a protest in Tahrir Square on 27 January.
The demonstration comes as part of nationwide anti-government rallies taking place in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez, Kafr El-Sheikh and Mahalla, among other cities.
