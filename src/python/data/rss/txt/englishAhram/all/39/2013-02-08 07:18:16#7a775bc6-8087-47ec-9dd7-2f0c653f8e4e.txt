Clashes in Kafr El-Zayat as protesters attack police station
Clashes erupt in the Delta city as a number of protesters attempt to storm a police station during anti-government protests
A number of unidentified protesters attempted to storm a police station in the city of Kafr El-Zayat in Gharbiya governorate, prompting clashes with police forces in front of the building, reported Al-Ahram Arabic.
Hundreds of anti-government protesters gathered in front of a police station Friday afternoon, setting fire to a number of car tyres to block off the surrounding area, and throwing rocks at the building.
When a group of unidentified assailants attempted to break into the station, police fired gunshots in the air and rounds of teargas to disperse protesters. Some protesters were taken to hospital suffering from tear gas asphyxiation.
Police forces also detained eight protesters. 
Opposition forces have called for mass protests on Friday to condemn police violence and call for social justice and the removal of the current Cabinet headed by Prime Minister Hisham Qandil.
