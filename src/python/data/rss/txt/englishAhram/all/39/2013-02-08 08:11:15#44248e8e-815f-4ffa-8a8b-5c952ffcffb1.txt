According to health ministry official Mohamed Sharshar, clashes in the Delta governorate of Gharbiya have resulted in 29 injuries so far on Friday afternoon, with injuries including severe breathing difficulties and fractures.
Clashes broke out in the Gharbiya cities of Mahalla, Tanta, and Kafr El-Zayat following anti-government protests.
In Mahalla, police fired tear gas at protesters when a group attempted to break into the Mahalla city council, and protesters responded by throwing Molotov cocktails at the building.
In Tanta, similar clashes erupted when a group attempted to storm the Gharbiya governorate building.
Clashes had broken out earlier on Friday in front of a police station in the Gharbiya city of Kafr El-Zayat.
The demonstrations in the Delta cities come as part of nationwide anti-government rallies taking place in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez, Kafr El-Sheikh and Mahalla, among other cities.
Clashes between protesters and security forces also broke out in Kafr El-Sheikh and Alexandria.
Demonstrations in the capital Cairo, where thousands marched on Tahrir and the presidential palace, remained calm into the early hours of Friday evening.
