BREAKING: Security fires shots into air as anti-Morsi protesters charge at presidential palace
Security forces fire shots into the air as some anti-Brotherhood protesters throw molotov cocktails and fireworks at the presidential palace
Security forces at the presidential palace fire shots into the air Friday evening to ward off hundreds of anti-President Mohamed Morsi protesters who have managed to remove the barricades surrounding one of the palace's gates.
Hundreds of protesters chanted "Down, down with the Brotherhood," as they removed the wires and barricades which the presidential guard had set up to seal the palace earlier on Friday.
A number of protesters threw Molotov cocktails and fireworks in the direction of the premises of the presidential palace.
Security forces are also using water hoses to clear protesters away from the palace's gates.
Demonstrations against the president have been taking place on Friday in a number of cities, and clashes with security forces have left tens injured in the Delta.
Last Friday during protests at the palace, two protesters was killed and scores were injured when fierce clashes broke out between security forces and protesters after a similar incident.
