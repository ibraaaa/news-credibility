German school organises pyramids run at Giza
German school Deutsche Evangelische Oberschule hosts annual 6km Pyramids Run of Giza on Friday
About 1,500 students, teachers and guests from several cities across Egypt started the run at 9.30am.
The course was 6km long, a distance all participants walked or ran with Egypt’s Pyramids of Giza in the background.
A sandstorm developed as the last runners finished the course, prohibiting the organisers to hold the award ceremony. The participants received their certificates and were honoured by school, concluding the event immediately to avoid the sandstorm.
"It was an overwhelming and unique experience to run through the desert seeing Giza Necropolis," said a participant from Germany.
A female runner commented on the run, taking not of the general solidarity among all runners at the event.
The Pyramids Run has become a tradition organised by the German school, held annually for more than 20 years.
