Egypt's Constitution Party link arms in solidarity with Port Said, Mansoura
Liberal Constitution Party members form human chains in Sharqiya in solidarity with protesters in the politically-turbulent governorates of Mansoura and Port Said
Ahmed Gamal, a Constitution Party member and Sharqiya-based coordinator for 6 April Movement, revealed that elements of the Muslim Brotherhood attacked the youth of his party, while participating in the chain.
"We filed a complaint in the police station as we were attacked by Brotherhood members while protesting against the government's policies," he said.
"The government cannot provide bread for us; we need a new one," protesters chanted.
The last two weeks have witnessed fierce clashes between protesters in Egypt’s Mansoura and Port Said governorates against police forces, causing severe cases of death and hundreds of injuries on both sides and leading the country into a state of political unrest.
