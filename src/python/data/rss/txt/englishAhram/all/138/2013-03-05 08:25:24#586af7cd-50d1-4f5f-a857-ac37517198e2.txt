Ghazl El-Mahalla win in Egyptian league as Group A race heats up
Ghazl El-Mahalla move only one point behind Group A leading trio with a 2-1 victory over Wadi Degla on Tuesday
Ghazl El-Mahalla claimed a 2-1 victory over Wadi Degla on Tuesday as Group A race in the Egyptian Premier League heated up.
Ahmed Magdy put Mahalla in front after five minutes and a late strike by Burkinabe midfielder Nouhoun Thiam put the result beyond doubt.
Degla's Full-back Mohamed El-Hosary pulled one back in stoppage time but it was too little, too late as Mahalla claimed all three points to climb to fourth in the table on eight points, one behind leading trio Haras El-Hodoud, ENPPI and Ahly.
In the same group, second-from-bottom Gouna played out a 1-1 draw with Bani Suef Telephones, securing a share of spoils through a penalty from Adel Mostafa on the hour mark.
In a new two-group format, the winners of the two groups will advance to play a mini-league with only home fixtures to determine the champion. The competition is being played behind closed doors at military-owned stadiums due to security concerns.
