Egypt's U-20 squad for this month's African Championship included highly-rated midfielder Saleh Gomaa, who has become a regular member of the Pharaohs' senior team roster.
Coach Rabie Yassine also picked Ahly's duo Rami Rabiea and Mahmoud Hassan, best known as "Trezeguet", who are part of the Red Devils' senior squad.
Gomaa, who plays for Premier League outfit ENPPI, played with the U-23 Egyptian team in last year's Olympics Games.
The list included two abroad-based footballers in Ahmed Hassan, who plays for Portuguese side Rio Ave, and midfielder Amir Adel, who plays for Feyenoord's youth team in the Netherlands.
