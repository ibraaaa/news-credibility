Art Alert: History of modern Egyptian art seminar in Zamalek
Seminar on 'History of Egyptian Modern Art (1900-1940s)' on Sunday, 3 March in Zamalek
ArtTalks will host a seminar entitled "The History of Egyptian Modern Art (1900-1940s)" on Sunday, 3 March in Cairo.
The seminar, which will be held at ArtTalks, a dynamic art education platform in Zamalek, will introduce participants to the history of modern Egyptian art and the movements that emerged as artists were searching for a nationalistic identity in the shadows of foreign occupation.  
"It examines the reasons behind the birth and rise of Egyptian modern art at the turn of the 20th century, with the founding of the Fine Arts School, all the way through to the Art & Freedom Group in the 1940s," reads the press release.
The seminar will use significant artworks by prominent artists as reference points, taking participants on a journey of discovery through the influences and the socio-political context in which modern Egyptian art evolved.
The seminar will be co-led by ArtTalks founder Fatenn Mostafa and art critic Mariam Hamdy.
Currently pursuing a PhD in Art History at Helwan University, Hamdy is a fine art critic, writer, and artist. After acquiring a BA in Performing and Visual Arts from the American University in Cairo, Hamdy completed an MA in Contemporary Fine Art at the Kent Institute of Art and Design.
Dedicated to building a new generation of art enthusiasts in Egypt, ArtTalks has previously organised a series of art education seminars, including: Top 25 Artworks from Egyptian Museum of Modern Art, Egyptian Surrealism, and an Art Appreciation seminar last month.
The seminar will cost LE300. More info
