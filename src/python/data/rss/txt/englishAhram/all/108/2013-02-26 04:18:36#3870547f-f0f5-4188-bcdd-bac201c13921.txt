Egypt's Arab Contractors seals $10 mn Nigeria deal
Construction giant Arab Contractors wins contract to build $10-million facility for Nigerian government in country's south
Egyptian state-run construction firm Arab Contractors on Tuesday announced it had clinched a $10 million deal to build a major government facility in Nigeria's southern Kanojo region, Egypt's official news agency MENA reported on Tuesday.
Arab Contractors is considered one of the most prominent construction firms in the Middle East and North Africa, and one of the largest companies in Egypt.
The latest deal comes as part of a series of other construction projects in Nigeria being managed by Arab Contractors.
In 2012 alone, the company submitted bids on construction projects in the West African nation worth a total of $165 million.
Nigeria has recently launched a programme aimed at modernising its crumbling infrastructure, contracting a number of major construction firms from around the world.
