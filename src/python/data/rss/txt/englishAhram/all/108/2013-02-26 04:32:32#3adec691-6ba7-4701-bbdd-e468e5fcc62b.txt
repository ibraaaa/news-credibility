Maradona appeals to clear name in Italian tax case
The Argentinean Legend Maradona appeals to clear name in Italian tax case
Diego Maradona has made a verbal appeal to Italian authorities to clear his name in a tax evasion case.
The Argentine great says ''I didn't kill anyone. I'm here to seek justice.''
Maradona's Italian debts of about $50 million stem from supposed unpaid taxes during the time he played for Napoli from 1984-91, a period in which he helped the club win its only two Italian league titles.
Maradona says Napoli club officials were responsible for his playing contract with the club.
He asks ''why do I have to pay and not them?'' adding, ''I'm a victim because I earned a lot but I didn't know anything about contractual questions. I'm showing my face because I didn't kill anyone.''
