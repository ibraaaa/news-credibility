Alexandria Ittihad coach threatens club president after dismissal
The coach of the Alexandria-based club rejects the club decision to fire him, threatens to take president El-Sadat to court
Ittihad of Alexandria fired coach Ahmed Sary following Monday's heavy 4-0 defeat against Petrojet in the Egyptian league, while the tactician vows to sue the club president.
The defeat left the coastal club in a crisis as it lies second from the bottom of Group B with just three points, 15 behind leaders Zamalek.
"The club board have decided to sack Sary after inciting players to depart the club's training camp ahead of Petrojet clash," Ittihad president Effat El-Sadat told a radio station after the match.
Earlier this month, Ittihad players have boycotted the training sessions as management failed to fulfill its promise to pay them a definite amount of their dues amid reports that the club faces a financial crisis
.
The troubles of the six-time Egypt Cup winners, Ittihad, deepened when the players left the team's training camp Sunday before returning again to feature against Petrojet.
The players were fined each LE100 thousand and will face an investigation questioned, according to the management decision.
Sary launched a severe attack on El-Sadat rejecting his dismissal.
"The club decision is not acceptable for me. I will file a legal complaint against El-Sadat for being responsible for administrative irregularities in the club," the former Ittihad star told a TV program.
"The president does not have the right to punish us as he always seeks his own benefit without offering any support for the team," he added.
The club president said that Sary is free to do what he wants, but he vowed to sue him if his accusations turned to be false.
