Burkina Faso coach congratulates Nigeria for winning the 2013 African Cup of Nations title
Burkina Faso coach Paul Put revealed that Nigeria is the best team in Africa and they deserve to win the 2013 African Cup of Nations.
Nigeria defeated Burkina Faso 1-0 in the CAN 2013 final on Sunday and claimed their third Africa Cup of Nations title when Sunday Mba scored the game's only goal in the 40th minute.
"We saw a great Nigeria, we know they have great players and they have also been growing in the tournament," Put told the post game press conference.
"I think they deserve to be the winners of this tournament," he added.
"We knew the progress Nigeria showed from their first game to their last game,"
"Burkina Faso have also been showing more maturity every game. We may have shown Nigeria too much respect in the first half, but it's football." Burkina Faso tactician said.
"In the second half we did everything possible but we were a little bit unlucky, so we have to be honest. You have to be great when you lose and you have to be small when you win." Put assert.
"My congratulations to Nigeria and also to my players." Burkina Faso coach concluded.
The Stallions won their group, eliminating defending champions Zambia, and reached the CAN 2013 final after beating Ghana 3-2 on penalties while their efforts were denied by Nigeria on Sunday and placed second.
