David Beckham to play with PSG against Marseille
Ancelotti says Beckham may make PSG squad for Marseille clash
David Beckham is likely to feature in the Paris St Germain squad for the first time when the Ligue 1 leaders take on arch rivals Olympique Marseille on Feb. 24, coach Carlo Ancelotti said on Monday.
Former England captain Beckham joined as a free agent last month but has to improve his fitness before he can challenge for a place in the squad.
Asked when Beckham would be fit to be called up, Ancelotti told French sports daily L'Equipe: "Against Marseille I think. We will see in the coming days but maybe he will be a bit on the short side for the Sochaux game (this weekend)."
PSG, who lead second-placed Olympique Lyon by six points, travel to Valencia on Tuesday for the first leg of their Champions League last 16 tie.
