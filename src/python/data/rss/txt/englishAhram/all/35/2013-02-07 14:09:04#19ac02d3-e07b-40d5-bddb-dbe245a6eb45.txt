Protesters close  Qalioubiya governorate building, cut Corniche road
Protesters in Banha, capital of Qalioubiya governorate, prevented employees at the governorate headquarters entering Thursday, demanding dissolution of Egypt's Cabinet
Protestors in Qalioubiya governorate, in Egypt's Delta, stopped employees from entering the governorate building Thursday after setting up tents at its doors demanding the dissolution of Egypt's Cabinet.
Several political forces, most prominently the National Salvation Front (NSF) and 6 April Youth Movement, marched Wednesday in Banha city, capital of Qalioubiya, where the governorate building is located.
Protestors ended their march at the governorate building and have stayed there since. They also blocked the Nile Corniche road in Banha.
In addition to demanding the Cabinet be dissolved, protestors are also calling for modifying controversial articles in the constitution, dismissing prosecutor-general Talaat Abdulla, who was appointed by President Morsi in November, and launching a national dialogue that would include all political forces effectively.
Qalioubiya's governor, Adel Zayed, declared an exceptional holiday Thursday for all governorate building employees.
The NSF and several opposition forces have called for mass protests Friday under the banner "Toppling the regime."
