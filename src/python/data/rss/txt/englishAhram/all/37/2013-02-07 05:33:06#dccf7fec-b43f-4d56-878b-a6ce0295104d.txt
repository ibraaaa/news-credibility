Opposition forces set for protests against Morsi government Friday
Rallies will take place in Tahrir Square, at the presidential palace, and outside Cairo
A number of political parties and groups are mobilising for mass anti-government protests on Friday.
The day’s protests have been given different monikers in the media, with some labelling it “Departure Friday,” while the 38 organisations that are behind the call to demonstrate described it as “the Friday of human dignity” in the press release they issued on Wednesday.
"Together on the Friday of human dignity, Egyptians will assert every day that they are free and they will not be enslaved or accept injustice, and will not allow their blood or dignity to be violated by police, or president, or a group," read the statement.
Among the parties and movements that declared their participation in the protests on Friday were the Constitution Party, the Popular Current, the Free Egyptians Party, the Maspero Youth Union, the Coalition of Revolutionary Powers, the Free Front for Peaceful Change, the Suez Revolutionaries Bloc, the Revolutionary Socioalists, the Mahalla Revolution, the National Front for Justice and Freedom and the Youth of the Democratic Front Party.
The call to protest raised political and economic grievances, including “the sacrifice of social justice for the sake of the IMF loan” and the issue of torture and detention of protesters.
The call comes after widely published reports of human rights violations against protesters involved in recent anti-government protests, including reports of torture.
According to the liberal Constitution Party, the protests will include several rallies from locations in Cairo and Giza following Friday prayers (mid-afternoon), to both Tahrir Square and the presidential palace in Heliopolis.
There are also protests and rallies planned in several governorates including Ismailia, Suez, Alexandria, Mahalla, Sharqiya and Menoufiya.
