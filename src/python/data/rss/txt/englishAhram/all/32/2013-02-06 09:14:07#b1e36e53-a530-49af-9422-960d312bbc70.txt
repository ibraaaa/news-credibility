Egypt's Zidan slams Bani Yas coach Chovanec
Egypt's forward Mohamad Zidan says Bani Yas coach Jozef Chovanec is the main reason for his exit from the UAE club
Egyptian forward Mohamed Zidan said on Wednesday that Bani Yas coach Jozef Chovanecis the one to blame for his departure from the UAE club.
The 31-year-old, who joined Bani Yas last summer, was omitted from the team's squad for the rest of the season after the club signed his compatriot Mohamed Abou-Treika on a six-month loan deal earlier  this week.
According to the UAE league's rules, clubs have the right to sign only four foreign players, and given that Bani Yas already have four foreign players at the disposal, they were obliged to offload one of them.  They eventually chose to dispense with Zidan.
"A member of the club's board informed me that coach Chovanec didn't want me at the club", Zidan told Emirati newspaper Al-Ittihad on Wednesday.
"It is so strange. Even If he dropped me from the team's squad, I would remain a player in the club.  
"Anyway, I still have 1-1/2 years remaining on my contract with the club and I am committed to completing my contract.
"The coach used to criticize me during training, accusing me of being selfish, which is completely false," he added.
The former Borusssia Drotmund forward, who spent 11 years plying his trade in Europe, said he believed Chovanec was incompetent.
"The coming days will show that Chovanec is incapable to manage a team like Bani Yas, and the club officials will soon discover that the points the club gained are merely down to the efforts of the players," Zidan commented.
Zidan is the second Egyptian player to be offloaded by a UAE club after Mahmoud Abdel-Razek 'Shikabala', who was shown the door by Al-Wasl after a brief six-month spell.
