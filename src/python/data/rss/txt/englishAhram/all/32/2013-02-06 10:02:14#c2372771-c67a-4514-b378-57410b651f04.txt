Egypt's presidency won't stay silent on torture cases: Spokesman
Presidential spokesman calls on media to refrain from assigning blame for torture, death of slain activist Mohamed El-Gendy before prosecutors conclude investigation
Presidential spokesman Yasser Ali on Wednesday stated that Egypt’s presidency would “not remain silent” on cases of human rights breaches, in reference to alleged torture suffered by slain activist Mohamed El-Gendy at the hands of police.
Ali made the statement at a press conference held parallel to the ongoing summit of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) in Cairo.
The presidency, the spokesman added, was still awaiting results of ongoing investigations into the case of El-Gendy, who had been a member of the leftist Egyptian Popular Current movement.
Ali went on to urge local media to refrain from pointing fingers and assigning blame for El-Gendy’s death before prosecutors wrapped up their investigation.
Hundreds have been detained by authorities since last Friday’s clashes between anti-government protesters and security forces outside the Presidential Palace in Cairo.
El-Gendy was allegedly tortured while in police custody before being taken to hospital where he succumbed to injuries days later.
