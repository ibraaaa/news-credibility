Ismaily open league campaign with win over El-Geish
Ismaily and Dakhleya register wins in their first Egyptian Premier League games on Sunday
Ismaily opened their Egyptian Premier League campaign with a 1-0 victory over El-Geish on Sunday.
Midfielder Ahmed Khairy scored the winner four minutes after the restart when he raced clear on goal following a through pass from forward Omar Gama.
The coastal side, who won the last of three league titles in 2002, play in Group B as the league's format was changed due to shortage of time.
 
Earlier on Sunday, hosts Arab Contractors slumped to a 1-0 loss to Dakhleya in the same group, thanks to a late goal by Mohamed Sebaie.
In Group A, Alexandria-based club Smouha, who spent big to bolster their squad, needed late a goal from Malian defender Issiaka Eliassou to salvage a 1-1 draw with Bani Suez Telephone, who opened the scoring in the 57
minute via goal from winger Alaa Ali.
The league finally went ahead after a one-year stoppage in the wake of last year’s Port Said disaster, which left over 70 Ahly fans dead following the end of an ill-tempered match against Masry.
