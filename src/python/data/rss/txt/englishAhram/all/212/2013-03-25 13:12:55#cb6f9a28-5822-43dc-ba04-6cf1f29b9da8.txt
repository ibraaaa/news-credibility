Ghana coach extols players after Sudan smash
Players were really disciplined and they played their best during the 4-0 win over Sudan, says Ghana coach
Ghana coach Kwesi Appiah has praised the performance of his team's players following their thrashing Sudan 4-0 in Accra in the 2014 World Cup qualifiers on Sunday.
Al-Ain's striker Asamoah Gyan opened the scoring for Ghana in the 19th minute and midfielder Mubarak Wakaso doubled the lead six minutes before the break. Forward Abdul Majeed Waris added the third in the 79th minute and substitute Emmanuel Badu completed the rout five minutes later.
“I believe tactically the players were really disciplined and they played their best to get the win for the nation,” Appiah told the post-game press conference.
“The team is in a building process, we are trying to build a winning side." He added.
“But I was impressed tactically how we defended and how we attacked the opponent.
“There were a few lapses which are normal but we will make sure we make amends in our next game but overall the performance was really good.”
The Black Stars remained second in Group D with six points, just one point behind leaders Zambia, who were held to a 1-1 draw by Lesotho.  
Ghana will play their upcoming games away from home against Sudan and Lesotho in June before hosting Zambia in the final group game in September.
