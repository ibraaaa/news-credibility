Well-known TV host Yosri Fouda suffers fractured neck in car accident in Red Sea resort of Hurghada
Renowned Egyptian TV anchor Yosri Fouda was transported to a hospital in Cairo late on Sunday after being injured in a car accident in the Red Sea resort town of Hurghada.
"A tyre on Fouda's car blew out and the car flipped over," journalist Yasser El-Zayat said.
“The accident was severe but he is aware and speaking,” El-Zayat said via Twitter.
Fouda has a fractured neck but it is treatable, El-Zayat added.
After receiving initial medical treatment at Al-Gouna hospital in Hurghada, Fouda was transferred by helicopter to Cairo’s Dar El-Fouad hospital.
Fouda is the presenter of
Akher Kalam
, one of Egypt's most popular talk shows, and he was formerly a reporter at the BBC and Al Jazeera. He is the co-author of
