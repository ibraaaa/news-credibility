Ghana coach unhappy with second-half display despite CAN win
Ghana coach promises to avoid the mistakes his team did against Cape Verde clash despite reaching the CAN 2013 semi-final
Ghana coach Kwesi Appiah said he was unhappy with the team's performance in the second half of their 2-0 win over Cape Verde in the quarterfinals of the African Cup of nations.
"The first half was okay," Appiah told reporters after the game.
"The second half was not one of our best games but I think we’ve got more room for improvement," he added.
The four-time African champions booked a last-four berth after two goals from substitute Mubarak Wakaso ended  the fairytale of tournament debutants Cape Verde.
 "We were playing so well until when we had the first goal. That was when we had some deficiencies in our midfield," Appiah added.
"On a whole our mental attitude was really good. Cape Verde dominated the second half, but we stood up and and the most important thing was that we got the win at the end of the day."
