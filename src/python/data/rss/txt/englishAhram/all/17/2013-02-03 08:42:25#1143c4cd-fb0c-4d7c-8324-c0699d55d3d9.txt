Gyan says Ghana’s experience was decisive in CAN progress
Ghana’s striker believes that experience was the most important factor in helping the team reach the Nations Cup semi-final at the expense of Cape Verde
Ghana striker Asamoah Gyan said on Sunday experience was decisive in helping the Black Stars claim a 2-0 win over Cap Verde in the Africa Cup of Nations quarter-finals on Saturday.
Mubarak Wakaso hit two goals as four-time champions Ghana secured their place in the tournament’s semis.
“The first half was a bit frustrating,” Gyan told the Ghana FA official website on Sunday.
“We couldn’t go through their defence. But what made the difference in our victory, was the penalty. When we scored, the game became opened.
“Although in the second half they dominated, we stood firm. We have experience and we kept our composure and in the late stages, we scored our second goal.
“In tournaments, it’s about you winning and qualifying to the next stage of the competition. Especially in the quarter-final, when you lose a game, then you are out of the competition,” the Ghana captain added.
The 27-year-old praised Cape Verde’s fairytale campaign despite their elimination from the quarters.
Cape Verde, who qualified  for CAN at the expense of heavyweights Cameroon, sprang another surprise after reaching the tournament’s quarter-final.
They finished second in Group A behind hosts South Africa, who also exited the Nations Cup after their 3-1 loss to Mali on penalties following a 1-1 draw.
 “I would want to congratulate the Cape Verde team. I respect them a lot,” Gyan commented.
“They’ve really come so far and I think with the kind of game that they are playing, in the next few years, they will improve their type of play.”
