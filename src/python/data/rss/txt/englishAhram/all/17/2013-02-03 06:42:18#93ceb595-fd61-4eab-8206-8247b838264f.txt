Second Egyptian protester dies from wounds sustained in palace clashes
Amr Saad Abdel-Rahman, 20, dies of injuries sustained in Friday clashes with security forces outside Egypt's Presidential Palace
A 20-year-old Egyptian on Sunday succumbed to injuries sustained during Friday's clashes outside the Presidential Palace in Cairo.
Amr Saad Abdel-Rahman was hit with birdshot during street battles between anti-government protesters and security forces on Friday outside the palace, located in the northeast Cairo suburb of Heliopolis. He died in hospital on Sunday afternoon.
Abdel-Rahman was the second victim of recent violence outside President Mohamed Morsi's official residence.
Mohamed Hussein Korani, also known as 'Kresty,' died after being shot in the neck and chest with birdshot during Friday's violence.
Egypt has witnessed intermittent clashes in several governorates between anti-government protesters and security forces since the second anniversary of the January 25 Revolution, since which over fifty deaths have been reported.
