Production resumes at Faragalla factories, striking workers arrested
Faraglla Group resumes production at factories in Alexandria, striking workers arrested for ‘inciting violence’
Mohamed Farag Amer, chairperson of Faragalla Group, announced on Thursday the continued closure of all the group's factories in Alexandria amid labour unrest.
He claimed he was being blackmailed by striking workers and thus could not "resume production in such conditions."
Abdel-Salam and 27 other workers have been arrested and put under investigation after managers accused them of inciting violence and destroying private property.
The 28 workers are restricted from entering the factory's premises, said the Egyptian Centre for Trade Union and Workers Services.
The group's management said the workers' syndicate had suspended its strike and negotiations were ongoing between management and workers on several issues, including higher wages, temporary employment and working hours.
Faragalla Group is a private-sector company established in 1973 by Mohamed Farag Amer. The group has three separate food processing companies, encompassing 22 production lines, according to the group's website.
