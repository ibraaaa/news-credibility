Protesters close Tahrir Square to traffic but leave presidential palace
Protesters in Egypt left the Ittihadeya presidential palace after Friday demonstrations, but others continue to block Tahrir Square to traffic despite negotiations with the interior ministry
Tahrir protesters placed metal barriers at the square's main entrances to prevent any vehicles from entering.
Egypt's interior ministry had offered to remove some of the
barriers they had built if protesters would allow traffic to flow through streets they had closed.
The interior ministry would unblock streets such as those near the ministry itself and the US embassy, however, negotiations seem to have failed. 
Protesters have been holding a sit-in in Tahrir Square since 22 November when President Morsi issued a controversial constitutional declaration that rendered his decisions above judicial intervention.
Meanwhile, there weren't any protestors at the
 
Ittihadeya presidential palace in Cairo’s Heliopolis suburb
Saturday morning after hundreds staged a demonstration there Friday against what they called the "Brotherhoodisation of the state."
Hundreds of protesters staged anti-government rallies across Egypt on Friday on what they called, "The day of putting the regime on trial."
