El-Merrikh reconcile with Egypt goalkeeper El-Hadary
The Pharaohs experienced guard, who recently reversed his decision to retire from international football, might return to action Wednesday
Egypt's goalkeeper Essam El-Hadary could return to action soon after settling a salary problem with Sudanese club El-Merrikh.
The veteran player recently went on strike, not attending training sessions with the Sudanese giants in protest for not being paid his salary, but it seems that matter is settled now and he might be fit for the next match.
"The club management reached an agreement with El-Hadary over his delayed financial dues," Sudanese online newspaper Cover revealed on Saturday.
"The player could be available for Wednesday's match against Al-Nsoor in the second round of the domestic league," the newspaper added.
The 40-year-old player, El-Hadary, has recently reversed his decision to retire from international football after being dropped by the national Egyptian team's American coach Bob Bradley during the 2-1 loss to Chile in a friendly earlier this month.
El-Hadary is widely considered the best keeper in Egypt's history. He played an instrumental role in steering the team to three consecutive African Nations Cup titles in 2006, 2008 and 2010.
Egypt is preparing for their game against Zimbabwe in the World Cup qualifiers next month.
The Pharaohs national team is leading Group G with six points, three points ahead of second-placed Guinea.
