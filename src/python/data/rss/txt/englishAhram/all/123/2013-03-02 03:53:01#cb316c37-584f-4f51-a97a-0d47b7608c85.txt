Fresh clashes break out in Egypt’s Mansoura, dozens injured
Dozens injured after clashes erupt between police and protests in the Nile Delta city of Mansoura
 
Dozens were injured in the early hours of Saturday when fresh clashes broke out between protesters and riot police in the Nile Delta city of Mansoura.
According to Ahram’s Arabic-language news website, the melee started when police forces fired tear gas at protesters in front the Daqahliya governorate headquarters as clashes in the restive city of Mansoura continued for a sixth day.
The Egyptian Popular Current, which was founded by ex-presidential candidate Hamdeen Sabbahi, said police had laid siege to its bureau in the city. It also said four were killed in the clashes, quoting a doctor in a makeshift clinic.
However, the Popular Current’s account was not immediately confirmed.
Eye witnesses said a police truck ran over a protester, according to Ahram’s news website, while a footage broadcast on satellite channel ONTV showed police dragging and beating up a man captured in the clashes.
The clashes in Mansoura erupted earlier this week as nationwide demonstrations against president Mohamed Morsi’s rule intensified.
The likes of Port Said, Ismailia, Suez, Mahalla and Tanta have witnessed deadly clashes since the second anniversary of the Egyptian revolution. Calls for civil disobedience were also common in the restive cities.
