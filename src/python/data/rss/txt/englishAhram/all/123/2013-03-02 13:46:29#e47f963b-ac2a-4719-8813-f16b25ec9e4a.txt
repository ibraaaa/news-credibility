Black Bloc and 'Hooligans' to head to Nile Delta city to 'avenge'
Opposition groups Black Bloc and The Hooligans warn they will escalate their tactics; plan to travel to Mansoura to protect protesters and avenge those killed in police-protester clashes
Radical opposition groups 'Black Bloc' and The 'Hooligans' announce they will head to Mansoura city in the Nile Delta where clashes have intensified between protesters and Egyptian police.
Some of the Delta cities including Mansoura are into their sixth day of civil disobedience to protest against President Mohamed Morsi, which has escalated to clashes with police, leaving one dead and dozens injured in the early hours of Saturday morning.
A statement on several Facebook pages under the opposition groups' names reads that they will go to Mansoura on Saturday "not [to participate] in a civil disobedience, but to protect [people's] blood and avenge the bodies that were dragged on the ground.
"We promise you that you will see a different [approach] from us... but you are the ones who forced us [into this]."
"You will see among us youth who will go to death, like you rush for life; for us martyrdom is sacred... Wait for [our anarchy] soon," they warned.
The Black Bloc first appeared in January as a radical opposition group of young protesters on the second anniversary of the January 25 Revolution.
They participated in anti-government demonstrations and were known for blocking roadways and metro lines.
At one point, Prosecutor-General Talaat Abdallah ordered the arrest of members of the group as part of the investigations on "sabotage, rioting and intimidation of citizens."
The clashes broke out in Mansoura after riot police reportedly fired tear gas at protesters at the Daqahliya governorate headquarters.
The calls for civil disobedience have led to protests and clashes in Egypt's Suez Canal cities, Port Said, Ismailia and Suez and recently the Delta cities of Mahallah and Mansoura.
