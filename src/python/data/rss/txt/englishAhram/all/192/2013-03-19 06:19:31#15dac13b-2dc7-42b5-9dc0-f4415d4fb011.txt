Egypt's Fathi tired of warming bench with Hull City
Ahly star Ahmed Fathi, currently on loan to Hull City, praises countryman Gedo but voices frustration with long stint on sidelines
"I train very hard; I play for the reserves, but I stay on the bench. I don't know why," the Ahly midfielder was quoted as saying by UK newspaper The Independent.
The 28-year-old, who joined Hull City on a six-month loan deal during the January transfer window alongside countryman Mohamed Nagy 'Gedo,' has since made few appearances with the English side.
"The manager in Egypt [Ahly's Hossam El-Badry] told me before I came here, 'Don't go please – the league will start again and I need you'. But I made my choice and came here," he said.
"But that's football," the holder of several Egyptian and African trophies – won with both Ahly and Egypt – added. "And I have to work."
Teammate Gedo, meanwhile, has played a leading role with Hull, scoring five goals in nine matches.
"I'm not surprised about Gedo," said Fathi. "I know he's a very good player – physical, fast, and when he has a chance, he scores."
"But with Ahly, he has many more chances. Here, I tell him, 'There will not be so many chances. Here you have a chance, you must score' – and he has," he added.
Fathi went on: "Now, Ahly are playing in the CAF Champions League again. They would probably like me and Gedo back, but we have contracts with Hull. That being said, I came from Egypt to play."
