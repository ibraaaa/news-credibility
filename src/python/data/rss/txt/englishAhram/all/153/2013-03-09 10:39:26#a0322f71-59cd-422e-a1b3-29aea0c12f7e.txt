African Nations Cup not stolen: Egypt's prosecution
The African Nations Cup trophy is safe after the Egyptian Football Association (EFA) headquarters was ransacked
The African Nations Cup trophy was not stolen after the Egyptian Football Association (EFA) was torched and ransacked, according to Egypt's prosecution.
According to Ahram's Arabic-language news website, the public prosecution said some EFA officials managed to safeguard some trophies including the prestigious Nations Cup.
However, pictures posted on social network showed some youth carrying the Nations Cup trophy outside the EFA building. EFA spokesman Azmy Megahed refused to confirm whether the trophy was stolen when contacted by Ahram Online.
"It's not about a cup, it's the history of Egyptian football. Everything is ruined," he said in a dejected tone.
Egypt kept a special full size replica of the gold-plated cup after winning three Nations Cups on the trot in 2006, 2008 and 2010.
The EFA headquarters was torched by angry Ahly fans on Saturday after a court verdict acquitted seven security officials in the infamous Port Said football disaster case.
