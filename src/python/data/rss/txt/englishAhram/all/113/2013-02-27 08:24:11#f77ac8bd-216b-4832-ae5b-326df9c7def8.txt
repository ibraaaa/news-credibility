Zamalek's regular keeper handed hefty fine as row escalates
Abdel-Wahed El-Sayed handed a LE75,000 fine for publicly criticising the club over unpaid salaries
Zamalek's regular keeper Abdel-Wahed El-Sayed, a fan favourite, was hit with a LE75,000 fine by the club after criticizing the board over unpaid salaries.
The cash-strapped side, who made an impressive start to their Egyptian Premier League campaign, are struggling to afford the monthly payments of their players, who made no secret of their frustration.
"We have decided to fine team skipper Abdel-Wahed El-Sayed LE75,000 for criticising the board of directors in statements released to the media," Zamalek said on their website.
"Right-back Ahmed Samir was also fined LE35,000 for criticising board member Ibrahim Youssef. The player's apology was taken into consideration and the punishment was lenient."
El-Sayed accused the board of not supporting the disgruntled players following Monday's 2-1 comeback victory over Arab Contractors.
The 35-year-old was quoted by local media as saying that he, as a team captain, had the right to speak about the players' problems.
Zamalek garnered maximum 15 points from their first five league games as they chase the elusive Premier League title which they had not won since 2004.
