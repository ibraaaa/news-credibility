Zamalek's missing coach Vieira returns to Cairo
After failing to show up for work for the last few weeks, the Whites coach finally reappears
Zamalek Portuguese manager Jorvan Vieira will lead the team against Ittihad El-Shorta in the domestic league after returning to Cairo early on Saturday, the Cairo giants announced.
The 59-year-old coach had not returned to Cairo after a friendly tournament in the UAE last month. His absence sparked rumours he was considering leaving his post.
Vieira, who took charge of the team in August on a two-season contract, told the club management that he was absent for a personal matter, insisting that he is committed to his contract.
The Whites had a good start for the Egyptian Premier League season after winning their first match against Ittihad of Alexandria 2-0 on Sunday. They will take on Ittihad El-Shorta in the second round of the tournament.
The league kicked off last week after a one-year suspension following the Port Said Stadium disaster that left over 70 Ahly fans dead after a match with rivals Masry.
Zamalek have not lifted the domestic trophy since 2004.
