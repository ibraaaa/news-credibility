Egypt military warns of potential impersonation of security personnel
Tunnel near Egypt's border with besieged Gaza Strip is found to contain fabrics used in Egyptian military and police uniforms; military spokesman warns of impersonations
A tunnel opening discovered recently in the Sinai Peninsula’s El-Saroserya region near Egypt’s border with the Gaza Strip was found to contain fabrics used in uniforms worn by Egyptian soldiers, an Egyptian military spokesman said in a Sunday statement.
According to the spokesman, three different fabrics resembling those used in Egyptian military uniforms, along with two white fabrics similar to those used in Egyptian police uniforms, were found at the tunnel opening.
“The armed forces calls on Egyptians to show vigilance in the days ahead in the event of any incident involving the impersonation of military personnel,” the spokesman said.
