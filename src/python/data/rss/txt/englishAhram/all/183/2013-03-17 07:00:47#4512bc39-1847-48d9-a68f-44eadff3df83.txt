Kenyans Kipsang, Rotich win NYC half marathon
Wilson Kipsang won the New York City half marathon in freezing temperatures on Sunday, and Caroline Rotich was first in the women's race
Kipsang finished the 13.1 miles in 1 hour, 1 minute, 2 seconds. Italy's Daniele Meucci was second, four seconds back. American Dathan Ritzenhein finished third in 1:01:10.
''I am very happy and grateful to win this race,'' Kipsing said. ''It was very cold from the start in Central Park, but I was feeling good. It was a very strong field, but I got in a position to break through and win this race.''
