On Mother's Day, raising awareness of breast cancer
Campaign launched in time for Mother's Day to provide Egyptian women with free mammograms
At a certain stage in a woman's life, maintaining regular health check-ups could make a difference between life and death. Urging mothers to attend regular screenings and checkups is a sign from their beloved ones that they care deeply.
With Mother's Day around the corner, a mammogram could be an ideal gift.
In celebration of Mother's Day, the Breast Cancer Foundation Egypt (BCFE) is launching a campaign that includes offering free mammograms for women over the age of forty in its office. The campaign will man educational booths at the Heliopolis Club, Downtown Mall, and Arkan mall in 6th October, offering brochures and raising awareness.
Women can call the BCFE on 19417 from 9am to 3pm to book a free mammogram, an offer that is valid from 14 March until Mother's Day.
In Egypt, according to the statistics provided by the National Cancer Institute, 36 percent of cancer cases are breast cancers, a number increasing in Egypt as well as worldwide.
Dr Mohamed Shaalan, chairman of BCFE, says that although almost 90 percent of breast cancer cases are curable if detected early, it is very important to keep on raising awareness, as women still do not take steps towards screening or medical treatment until the cancer is spread and at an advanced stage.
Dr Wafaa Abdel Hadi, clinical oncologist at Cairo University, told Ahram Online that the annual mammogram check for women above 40 is essential, and stressed that mammograms could be more frequent if there is a family history of breast cancer.
According to Abdel Hadi, because cancer is increasingly occurring at a younger age, the new recommendations suggests that apart from the monthly self examination, women above the age of 20 should have a clinical breast examination with an oncologist every three years.
