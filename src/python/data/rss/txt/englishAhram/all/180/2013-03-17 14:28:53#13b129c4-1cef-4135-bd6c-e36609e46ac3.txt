Egypt claim late victory over Ghana in U-20 African Championship
Egypt beat heavyweights Ghana 2-1 in their opening game of the U-20 African Championship on Saturday
 
Midfielder Saleh Gomaa struck with three minutes remaining to give Egypt a precious 2-1 victory over Ghana in their opening game of the U-20 African Championship on Saturday.
The young Pharaohs took the lead in the 67
th
minute when substitute Mahmoud Hammad rose at the near post to head a free-kick into the far corner of the net.
Fourteen-year-old Ebenezer Assifuah brought Ghana level in the 76
th
minute when he capitalized on the defence’s failure to clear the danger to slot home from close range.
However, ENPPI’s rising star Gomaa, who is regularly called up by Egypt’s senior team, gave Egypt all three points when he converted a penalty after Mahmoud Abdel-Moneim “Kahraba” was felled by the keeper.
Egypt are on top of Group A with three points, two ahead of hosts Algeria and Benin who drew in Saturday’s earlier game.
