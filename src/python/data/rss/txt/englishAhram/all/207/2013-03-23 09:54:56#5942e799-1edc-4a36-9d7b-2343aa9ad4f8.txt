African champions Nigeria score in stoppage time to salvage draw with Kenya
Nigeria need a last-gasp goal to avoid a defeat by Kenya in the World Cup qualifiers on Saturday
Nations Cups winners Nigeria scored deep in stoppage time to salvage a 1-1 draw at home to Kenya in the World Cup qualifying Group F on Saturday.
Minnows Kenya took a surprising lead after 36 minutes, thanks to a goal from Francis Kahata.
However, Nnamdi Odumadi struck three minutes into the injury time to secure a share of spoils as the Super Eagles, who won the Nations Cup last month after defeating Burkina Faso in the final, avoided a stunning loss.
Nigeria remain on top of the group with five points from three matches, ahead of second-placed Malawi on goal difference after the latter claimed a 1-0 away victory over Namibia in the other group game, thanks to a 70
th
-minute strike from Gabadin Mhango.
Namibia are third on three points while Kenya lie at the bottom with two.
The group winners will advance to a decisive two-legged playoff that will determine Africa's five representatives at next year's World Cup in Brazil.
