Zamalek coach wary of Ismaily clash, optimistic over Vita Club trip
Zamalek coach Jorvan Vierra says Ismaily game in the Egyptian premier league will be difficult, confident that his side will beat Vita Club in the second leg of the Champions League round of 32
 
Zamalek's Brazilian manager Jorvan Vieira refused to get carried away with the team's splendid run, saying the upcoming Egyptian Premier League clash against Ismaily will be difficult.
 The success-starved side, who made their best league start since 2003, are on top of Group B in the competition's new format with maximum 21 points from seven games, three ahead of nearest challengers Ismaily.
"The game against Ismaily will be different. They are our main competitors in the group and are a strong side. We hope to finish the first round of the league without any defeats," Vieira told a news conference on Saturday.
Zamalek will face Ismaily, who have 18 points, on 20 March.
The Cairo giants will also face a tough game away to DR Congo's Vita Club in the second leg of African Champions League round of 32 on 7 April.
Vieira said he is confident his side would be able to overcome Vita Club and book a last-16 berth despite only managing a narrow 1-0 home victory in the first leg.
 "I know we will face a bad weather in Congo but it won't affect the players' performance in the game," Viera said.
"We will start preparations for Vita Club game right after the Ismaily league game.
"The technical staff will focus on avoiding the mistakes that we did in the first leg to successfully continue our African campaign," he added.
Zamalek are bidding to win Africa's elite club competition for the first time since 2002.
