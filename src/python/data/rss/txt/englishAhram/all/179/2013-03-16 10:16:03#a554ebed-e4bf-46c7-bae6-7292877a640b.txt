Ivory Coast striker scores as Arsenal responds to European exit with Swansea win
Arsenal remained firmly in the race for Champions League qualification after Nacho Monreal and Gervinho secured a 2-0 win at Swansea on Saturday.
The Gunners went within two points of fourth-place Chelsea and four of third-place Tottenham, with their London rivals both playing on Sunday.
Monreal broke the deadlock in the 74th minute, lashing the ball beyond goalkeeper Michel Vorm with the help of a deflection off Ashley Williams to score his first Arsenal goal.
Gervinho wrapped up the win in stoppage time by slotting low beyond Vorm after being teed up by Aaron Ramsey.
Fifth-place Arsenal needs to finish in the top four to qualify for the Champions League. Arsene Wenger's side exited the European competition in the last-16 phase on Wednesday at the hands of Bayern Munich.
