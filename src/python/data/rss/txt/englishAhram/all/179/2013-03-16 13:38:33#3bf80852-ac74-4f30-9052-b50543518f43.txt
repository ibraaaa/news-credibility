Real Madrid fight back for 5-2 home win over Mallorca
Real Madrid smash Mallorca 5-2 in the 28th matchday of the Spain La Liga on Saturday
Real Madrid trailed twice before fighting back with three goals in a seven-minute span to beat Mallorca 5-2 on Saturday and avoid another slip-up to a low-profile Spanish league side.
Mallorca led 2-1 at Santiago Bernabeu Stadium after goals from Emilio Nsue and Alejandro Alfaro, both set up by Giovani dos Santos, with Gonzalo Higuain scoring in between for the hosts.
After a sluggish first half, Cristiano Ronaldo sparked Madrid to life with an equalizer in the 51st.
Luka Modric put Madrid ahead three minutes later with a screamer, similar to his Champions League goal against Manchester United, and Higuain added another in the 57th.
Karim Benzema scored in stoppage time.
Madrid trails leader Barcelona by 10 points after losing to Getafe, Granada, Real Betis and Sevilla this season.
