Hamas's Meshaal meets with Brotherhood Supreme Guide in Cairo
Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal held talks with Muslim Brotherhood leader about the situation in Palestine and Egypt
The leader of the Muslim Brotherhood, Supreme Guide Mohamed Badie, met with Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal on Saturday at the group’s main headquarters in Cairo’s Mokattam.
According to a statement published on the Muslim Brotherhood’s official Facebook page, the meeting tackled several issues, including Palestinian hunger strikers in Israeli prisons, the situation in both the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, and the future of reconciliation between Fatah and Hamas.
“Meshaal confirmed that Hamas along with the Palestinian people respect the interests and security of Egypt,” read the statement, adding that the Hamas government does not intend to interfere in any of Egypt’s internal affairs “for Egypt represents strong support for the Palestinian cause in the past, present and future.”
According to the statement, Meshaal told Badie that he is in touch with the Egypt authorities, including the presidency and the general intelligence service, to coordinate in serving Egypt’s national security.
The Muslim Brotherhood headquarters in Mokattam saw scuffles between its guards and dozens of demonstrators who gathered to chant against the group and its supreme guide later on Saturday.
Activist Ahmed Douma declared via his Twitter account that he received a slight injury to his face after being attacked "by the Muslim Brotherhood's thugs" as he was spraying graffiti denouncing the Islamist group.
