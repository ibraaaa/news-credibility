Syria death toll may have reached 90,000: John Kerry
 
US Secretary of State John Kerry said Thursday that the death toll in Syria may have reached 90,000, citing figures given to him by his Saudi counterpart Prince Saud al-Faisal.
"I had occasion ... to speak this morning with the foreign minister of Saudi Arabia. The first thing he mentioned to me was in his estimate perhaps as many as 90,000 people have been killed in Syria," Kerry told reporters.
