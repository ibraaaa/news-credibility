France bans firm that 'knowingly' sold horsemeat as beef
French firm Spanghero had its licence suspended
The French government on Thursday said the French firm Spanghero knowingly sold horsemeat as beef and that it was withdrawing the licence that allowed it to process meat.
Consumer Affairs Minister Benoit Hamon said the firm engaged in "fraud", and Agriculture Minister Stephane Le Foll said Spanghero's licence was being suspended while experts carried out tests on products at its processing plant.
