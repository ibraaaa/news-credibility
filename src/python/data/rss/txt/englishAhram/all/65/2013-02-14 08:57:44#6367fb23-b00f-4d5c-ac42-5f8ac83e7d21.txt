Zamalek players to strike over unpaid dues
Zamalek players refused to train on Thursday with salaries from last season still unpaid
Back to training a day after their victory against Dakhleya, the players appeared at the club on Thursday but refused to train until they receive salary instalments that date back to last season.
The Egyptian powerhouse failed to meet its obligations, despite making several promises to the players over recent weeks.
Like all Egyptian clubs, Zamalek suffered huge loss in revenue when domestic competitions were suspended last year following the February Port Said disaster.
The league was finally resumed on 2 February of this year.
Players were expecting a reward after their perfect start to the new season. They notched up a third straight league victory on Wednesday, beating Dakhleya 1-0.
The Cairo giants top Group B with nine points.
