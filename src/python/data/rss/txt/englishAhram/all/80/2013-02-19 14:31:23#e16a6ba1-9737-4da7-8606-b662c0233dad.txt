Seven die as Yemen military aircraft crashes in Sanaa: Medics
At least seven people killed following deadly helicopter crash near site of main protest square in Yemen
A Yemeni military aircraft ploughed into a building in a residential neighbourhood of Sanaa on Tuesday killing at least seven people, mostly civilians, the emergency services said.
The pilot and six civilians were killed in the crash which occurred near Change Square, an epicentre of the revolt that ousted president Ali Abdullah Saleh.
The toll is expected to rise as the aircraft crashed and badly damaged a building which houses residences and shops.
An AFP correspondent reported several ambulances reaching the scene of the crash while helicopters flew overhead.
Television footages showed thick black smoke billowing from the burning wreckage of the aircraft as residents gathered around it.
In November, an Antonov M26 of the Yemeni air force crashed during a training mission in a northern district of Sanaa, killing all 10 occupants.
