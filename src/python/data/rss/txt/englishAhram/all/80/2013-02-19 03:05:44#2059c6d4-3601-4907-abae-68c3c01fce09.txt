Beni Suef police strike, angry at escape of alleged cop-killer
Police are angry that Hossam Abou El-Regal, who is accused of killing a police officer, was 'allowed' to escape from hospital following a brutal assault
Police personnel and low ranking police officers went on strike on Tuesday in the Upper Egypt governorate of Beni Suef, in protest at the escape of alleged police-killer Hossam Abou El-Regal from hospital, where he had reportedly been taken on Saturday following a violent assault by police officers.
The protesters accuse the Director of Criminal Investigations, Brigadier General Zakareya Abu Zeina, of helping Abou El-Regal to escape, and demanded that Abu Zeina leave the Beni Suef Security Directorate.
Abou El-Regal was arrested on Saturday by several police officers and others at an apartment in Beni Suef, who accused him of killing police officer Hisham Abou Tama. They reportedly took him to the funeral of the slain officer, where he was tied down in a truck and beaten, apparently to death, as dozens of mourners watched.
On Sunday, reports that Abou El-Regal had survived the beating and been taken to Beni Suef Hospital after the attack began circulating.
According to an official at the hospital, around a hundred armed "outlaws" broke into the hospital Saturday night and took Abou El-Regal after they were told that he was in a coma and had not yet died.
The family of Abou El-Regal have accused police of being behind the kidnapping of their son.
