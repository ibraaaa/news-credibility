VIDEO: Ahly happy for Beni Suef win ahead of Africa Super Cup
Ahly pleased with a 2-0 league win against Beni Suef Telephones, focusing on the Super Cup
“Beating Beni Suef was essential for our league bid especially after the Smouha defeat in the last round. Now we will have to focus on the Africa Super Cup,” manager Hossam El-Badry told reporters after the game.
In previous rounds, the Cairo giants could only claim unconvincing 1-0 wins over Ghazl El-Mahalla and Wadi Degla before their frailties were exposed against Smouha.
“Of course, the team have been negatively affected by the absence of the injured and loaned players but the current squad are doing their best,” experienced defender Wael Gomaa who was quoted as saying by Ahly’s official website.
Ahmed Shedid Qenawy opened the scoring in the 20th minute against Beni Suef and Sayed Hamdi recovered his scoring instinct following a series of sluggish performances on the hour mark.
“I am very happy about my first goal with Ahly,” Qenawy, the winger, expressed adding that “the timing of this win is very important.”
The CAF Champions League winners will meet AC Leopards of Congo on 23 February in the African Super Cup.
“This victory is a boost for Ahly to win the Super Cup,” the Reds' keeper Sherif Ekrami commented.
