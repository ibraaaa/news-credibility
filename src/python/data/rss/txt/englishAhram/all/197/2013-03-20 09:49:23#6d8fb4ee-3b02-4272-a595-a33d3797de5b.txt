Ahly's Meteb rejects 'media exaggeration' after ending goal drought
The Ahly striker is happy to rediscover his scoring touch but says ending his lengthy goal drought did not deserve to attract media attention
Ahly striker Emad Meteb is delighted after ending an eight-month goal drought but believes the media coverage over the goals he scored in an African Champions League game was "exaggerated".
The 29-year-old scored twice to give Ahly a precious 2-1 away win over Tusker of Kenya in the first leg of the Champions league round of 32 last week.
"I am a striker; my role is to score goals, that's why I refuses any Kinds of exaggeration over the two goals I scored against Tusker," Meteb told Ahram Sports on Wednesday.
Meteb has come in for criticism lately after some disappointing displays that saw coach Hossam El-Badry relegate him to the bench.
"I was severely criticized recently. Their criticism of me was exaggerated, so I do not want their praise of me now to be exaggerated," he added.
