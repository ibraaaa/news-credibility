ENPPI go top of group with 4-1 Egyptian league win over Gouna
ENPPI thrash Gouna 4-1 in the Egyptian Premier League on Wednesday
ENPPI moved three points clear on top of Group A after securing a 4-1 win over Gouna in the Egyptian Premier League on Wednesday.
The petroleum outfit made up for their disappointing display in the 2-1 defeat by Ahly earlier this month to take temporary control of the group.  
Forward Moemen Zakaria gave ENPPI the lead in the first minute before a brace from Ahmed Raouf on 43 and 76 minutes, including a brilliant back-heel flick, put the result beyond doubt.
Gouna scored a consolation with eight minutes remaining before ENPPI forward Ahmed Omran put the icing on the cake in stoppage time.
ENNPI are leading Group A with 15 points, three ahead of defending champions Ahly who have two games in hand.
