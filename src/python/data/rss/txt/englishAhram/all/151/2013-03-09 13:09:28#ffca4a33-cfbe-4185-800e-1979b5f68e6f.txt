Taliban claims Kabul suicide attack during Hagel visit
The Taliban claimed responsibility for a suicide bomb in central Kabul during a visit to the Afghan capital Saturday by new US Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel.
"This was not a direct attack to target him but we want to send a message that we are always capable of hitting Kabul even when the top US defence official is there," Zabiullah Mujahid told AFP by telephone.
