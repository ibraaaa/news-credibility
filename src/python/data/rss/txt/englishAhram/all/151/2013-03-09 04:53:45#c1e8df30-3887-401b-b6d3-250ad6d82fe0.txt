BREAKING: UN peacekeepers taken to Syria-Jordan border - Rebels
A group of 21 UN Filipino peacekeepers captured by Syrian rebels three days ago have been taken to the border with Jordan to be handed over to Jordanian authorities, a rebel source and a violence monitoring group said on Saturday.
It was no immediately clear whether the peacekeepers had crossed into Jordan. They had been held in the village of Jamla, about one mile (1.6 km) east of the frontier with the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights and six miles (10 km) north of Jordan.
