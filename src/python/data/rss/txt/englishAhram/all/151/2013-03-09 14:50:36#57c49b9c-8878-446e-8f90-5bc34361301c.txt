We will not give up pursuing justice for victims: Ahly
Ahly management officially reacts to verdict on deadly Port Said football match, calling the ruling 'just' and vowing to continue fighting for the club victims' rights
Management of Cairo football giants Ahly lauds Egypt's judiciary after Saturday's verdict in the deadly Port Said football match trial, insisting the ruling is just and that the club will not give up until they obtain full justice for the victims.
Firstly, Egypt’s court confirmed the death sentences for 21 defendants that were originally announced on 26 January and were pending approval by the Grand Mufti, but who has yet to do so. The defendants were charged for their role in killing 72 Ahly fans during an Ahly v Masry match in the Port Said stadium on 1 February 2012.
The court also sentenced two senior police officers to 15 years, five more people to life in jail and acquitted 28. The remainder of the 73 defendants received shorter jail sentences for their role in the attack.
"The court's verdict was fair for Ahly fans," Ahly board said in a statement on the club's official website.
"The club management has full confidence in Egypt's judiciary and we support the prosecutor-general's decision to appeal the 28 acquittals.
"We will continue supporting the families of Port Said football victims and will not give up until we obtain justice for their sons," concluded the statement.
The hardcore fans Ultras Ahlawy, however, are currently gathering and reacting angrily, unsatisfied with the verdict.
This is in contrast with their reaction in January when the fans praised the first round of verdicts, where the court announced the death sentences for 21 defendants.
