ENPPI coach excited about signing striker Zaki
Short of strikers, Coach El-Ashry is confident Zaki will be able to offer more to ENPPI
ENPPI coach Tarek El-Ashry is excited about signing Egypt striker Amr Zaki, confident the striker will give more to the petroleum squad throughout the ongoing season.
"We signed a two-and-a-half year contract with Zaki because we believe in his ability to help the team," El-Ashry told a television program.
Egypt striker Amr Zaki signed a two-year contract with Egyptian Premier League side ENPPI after terminating his deal with Turkey's Elazigspor by mutual consent less than five months after joining.
"ENPPI suffers from a lack of strikers: we only have Ivorian Defone and Ahmed Raouf," the tactician added.
The 29-year-old forward, who joined the Elazig-based club late August and was supposed to stay for two seasons, had agreed with the club to leave amicably last month and joined ENPPI in a free transfer.
Zaki scored 36 goals for ENPPI during his previous stint at the petroleum club before moving to Zamalek in 2006, where he was loaned to English Premier League side Wigan Athletic in 2008-2009 and scored 11 goals in 33 matches. He also had a short spell at Hull City where he made six appearances.
"I hope Zaki stays fit and returns to his previous performance level," El- Ashry concluded.
