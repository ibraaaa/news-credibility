Bani Yas coach praises Abou-Treika after Dubai win
Coach Jozef Chovanec says Egypt's star forward was instrumental in bolstering team's performance during Friday's 5-0 win over Dubai in UAE League match
 
Bani Yas coach Jozef Chovanec on Sunday said that Egypt forward Mohamed Abou-Treika had positively affected the team's performance during Friday’s 5-0 win over Dubai in the UAE League.
"Abou-Treika managed to make the difference with the team by his superb performance," Chovanec said at a press conference.
The Egyptian star scored his second goal in as many appearances with Bani Yas, crushing Dubai FC 5-0 in the UAE’s Professional League on Friday.
"Abou-Treika led players to do their best during the game and managed to develop players' performance," Chovanec added.
The Egyptian playmaker, who has joined Bani Yas from Egyptian giants Ahly on loan until the end of the current season, played the full 90 minutes and managed to score his side's fourth goal in the 72nd minute.
As a result, Bani Yas moved to third plance in the league table with 31 points.
Last week, Abou-Treika scored during his debut with Bani Yas in a domestic cup game.
