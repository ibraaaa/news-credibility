Darfur recovery needs $6 billion: top official
The head of the Darfur Regional Authority appeals for international aid to economically lift Darfur and cement an unstable peace
The economic recovery of Sudan's war-ravaged Darfur region needs an estimated $6 billion, the region's top official said Sunday, appealing for international support 10 years after an insurrection began that led to deadly counter-campaigns by pro-government militias.
Eltigani Seisi made the comments in an interview with AFP ahead of a 7-8 April donors conference in Qatar.
Analysts are sceptical that significant funds will be forthcoming.
"If the international community refrains from providing support then how could we be able to stabilise the situation on the ground?" Seisi said.
"And how could the people of Darfur have dividends for peace?" he added.
Seisi's comments came after UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon reported in January that a 2011 armistice deal has yet to bring "concrete peace dividends" for the neediest in Darfur, where 1.4 million live in camps for people displaced by years of fighting.
Sudan's government signed the peace deal in Doha, Qatar, with an alliance of rebel splinter factions, but major insurgent groups rejected the pact.
Seisi heads the Darfur Regional Authority set up to implement the Doha agreement.
