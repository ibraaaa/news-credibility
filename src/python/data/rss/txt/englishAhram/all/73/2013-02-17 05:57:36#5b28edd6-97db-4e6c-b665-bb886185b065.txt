Hezbollah says two Lebanese Shiites killed in Syria
Two Lebanese Shiites have been killed in fighting in Syria, a Hezbollah official said Sunday, as the opposition accused the Shiite militant group of intervening on the side of its regime allies.
"Two Lebanese Shiites living in Syria were killed and 14 others wounded in clashes with rebels," the official told AFP on condition of anonymity, adding that they were acting in "self-defence".
