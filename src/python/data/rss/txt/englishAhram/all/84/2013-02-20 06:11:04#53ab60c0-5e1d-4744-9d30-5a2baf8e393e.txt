Egyptian presidency announces two new official spokesmen
Presidency appoints two new official spokesmen; Former spokesman Yasser Ali to head up state-run Information and Decision Support Centre
The Egyptian presidency on Wednesday declared on its official Facebook page that it had appointed Minister Plenipotentiary Omar Amar Youssef and Councillor Mostafa Fahmy as official presidential spokespersons.
Yasser Ali, the previous spokesman for President Mohamed Morsi, meanwhile, was transferred last Thursday to the state-run Information and Decision Support Centre (IDSC), at which he will take up the top post.
The presidency has yet to issue any information on the backgrounds of the two new presidential spokesmen.
