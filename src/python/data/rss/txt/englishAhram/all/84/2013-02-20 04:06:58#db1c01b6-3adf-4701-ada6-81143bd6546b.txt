Ahly squad thirsty for Africa Super Cup: Coach
Despite the absence of many key players, coach Hossam El-Badry says that the current squad is capable of defeating AC Leopards in CAF Super Cup
“Many key players are absent due to injuries and loans. Winning the CAF Super Cup is essential for them because they want to prove their worth,” El-Badry was quoted as saying on the Red Devils’ official website Wednesday.
Midfielder Mohamed Abou-Treika is on loan to UAE’s Bani Yas while winger Ahmed Fathi is on loan to English Championship side Hull City. Many other players are sidelined due to injuries, including skipper Hossam Ghali, left winger Sayed Moawad, and midfielders Ahmed Seddik and Walid Soliman.
“Leopards are a tough opponent as they won the CAF Confederation Cup,” the 53-year-old tactician said, “but we studied them well and we know their strengths and weaknesses.”
The match, which will be played in Egyptian military-owned stadium Borg El-Arab, will be open to the public. The Egyptian Premier league matches which kicked off this  month, after a year of suspension in the wake of the Port Said stadium disaster, were held behind closed doors due to security concerns  
“I miss seeing our fans in the stands,” Ahly striker Ahmed Abdel-Zahar said. “It will be a real boost for us to win the title.”
“I hope that the fans' attendance will be the password for victory,” striker Dominic Da Silva said.
