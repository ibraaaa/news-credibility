Clown street performers to stage several events
Outa Hamra (Red Tomato) are set to host three events in public spaces around Cairo on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday
Outa Hamra (Red Tomato), a company working in social and interactive theatre, is set to host two events, one in Mostafa Mahmoud Square in Mohandeseen and one in front of Cairo Mall in Haram, in solidarity with children who are forced to work. There will also be a clown performance in Geziret El-Dahab Island.
On Wednesday and Thursday, the events are hosted in solidarity with 'The National Day for Street Children' and will feature performances by street children nurtured under Outa Hamra.
On Friday, the Outa Hamra crew will perform their interactive show "A Clown Street Performance,"  which they plan to take to every governorate in Egypt.
Previous projects include several interactive performances dealing with refugees and street children. They were also part of Mahatat's large scale project 'Shawarena' (our streets) in 2012 bringing several forms of arts to the streets.
