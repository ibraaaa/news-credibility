One protester killed in Egypt's Port Said on Tuesday
Mohamed Hamed Farouk dies from head wound caused by teargas canister fired by police during protest in Port Said on Tuesday
A man died during protests in Port Said on Tuesday after being struck on the head with a teargas canister fired by police.
Mohamed Hamed Farouk, 30, died from a brain haemorrhage.
A health ministry spokesperson said 227 others were injured in clashes in the restive canal city on Tuesday.
The clashes took place near the Port Said security directorate, with protesters hurling stones and police firing back with birdshots and volleys of tear gas.
Parts of the city's security directorate and governorate headquarters were set ablaze on Monday by protesters throwing Molotov cocktails.
Clashes broke out on Sunday after relatives of local people currently on trial for their involvement in last year's Port Said Stadium disaster were informed that the defendants would be transferred to a prison outside the city.
At least six people have been killed in the latest wave of protests in the city, including three policemen.
Port Said has experienced intermittent unrest since 26 January, when a court sentenced 21 local residents to death for their involvement in last year’s Port Said stadium disaster, which killed more than 70 people.
