Japan jeweler unveils $5.25 m. Messi's golden foot
Ginza Tanaka puts a pure golden foot for Barcelona star Lionel Messi on sale for charity
A pure gold replica of Lionel Messi's left foot has been unveiled in Tokyo.
The foot, which is valued at $5.25 million, was created by Japanese jeweler Ginza Tanaka to commemorate the soccer player's achievements.
Messi's brother Rodrigo says ''it's exceptional. You can see each line in the foot. It's an impressive piece of work.''
The jeweler says he cast Messi's foot in Spain at the end of 2012.
Part of the proceeds will go to Messi's foundation, which in turn will go to support children in areas affected by the earthquake and tsunami disaster that hit Japan in March 2011.
