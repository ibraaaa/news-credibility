Egypt's second-string lose to Qatar in friendly
The Pharaohs second-string team lose to Qatar 3-1 in friendly game in Doha on Thursday
Egypt conceded a 3-1 defeat against Qatar on Thursday in a friendly game in Doha.   
The Pharaohs played with their second team as several players missed the game due to other club engagements.  
Egyptian players abroad missed the game as it is was not included on FIFA's calendar.
Zamalek, ENPPI and Ismaily's players also missed the game due to their club's commitments in the domestic league.  
Pharaohs' coach Bob Bradley was forced to introduce local-based players, such as Tarek Hamed, Ahmed Hamoudi (Smouha), and Hussein Hamdy (Maqassa), who played their first international match ever.
The Pharaohs started the game on a good note, opening the scoring in the third minute of the game, after a follow from Ahly's Youth midfielder Rami Rabie to Abdalah El-Said's cross.
However, Qatar reacted 25 minutes later with a nice close-range header from Qatar's striker Abdel-Kerim Hassan.
Qatar's defender scored the second goal for his national team with another nice header 10 minute after the break.
Abdel-Kerim Hassan added the third goal for Qatar in the injury time when he benefited from an Egyptian defensive lapse, which allowed him to score easily to an empty net.
The Pharaohs are preparing for their upcoming clash against Zimbabwe in the World Cup qualifier game set to be played in Alexandria's Borg Al-Arab stadium on 26 March.
