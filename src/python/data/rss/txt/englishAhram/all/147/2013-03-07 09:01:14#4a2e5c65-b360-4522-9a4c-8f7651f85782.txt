UPDATE 1: Over 30 police stations join strike against Egypt's interior minister
Amid waves of anti-government demonstrations, over 30 police stations across Egypt - including seven in Cairo - have closed their doors to protest the policies of Egypt's interior ministry
Thirty police stations nationwide, including seven in Cairo, closed their doors on Thursday to demand the dismissal of Minister of Interior Mohamed Ibrahim, state news agency MENA reported.
The officers and personnel at the police stations have declared a state of "rebellion against the interior ministry's policies," a police source told Al-Ahram's Arabic-language news website.
The stations involved in the Cairo strike are those located in the satellite city of Al-Shorouk in northern Cairo, Sayyida Zeinab, Misr Al-Qadima, Qasr El-Nil and Azbakeya in central Cairo, along with those in Madinet Nasr Awwal and Matareya in north-eastern Cairo.
Ibrahim has come under fire from police in several Egyptian provinces, who have accused him of having affiliations with the Muslim Brotherhood, the group from which President Mohamed Morsi hails.
They also accuse him of forcing police into unnecessary confrontations with citizens within the context of ongoing political unrest across the country.
