Moody's cuts Egypt's credit rating on 'unsettled' political conditions
Moody's the global investors' service cooperation downgrades Egypt
Moody's Investors Service on Thursday downgraded Egypt's sovereign foreign currency credit rating to Caa1 from B3, citing unsettled political conditions, and said risks of a default have increased.
The government's inability to secure financing from the International Monetary Fund has exacerbated a lack of predictability in the Middle East nation's economy and fiscal policies.
The outlook on the credit is negative, Moody's said in a statement.
Egypt is rated one notch higher at B-minus with a negative outlook by Standard & Poor while Fitch Ratings has Egypt two notches higher at B with a negative outlook.
