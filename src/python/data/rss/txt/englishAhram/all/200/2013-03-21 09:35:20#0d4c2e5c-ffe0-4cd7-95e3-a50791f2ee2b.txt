Ahly's Moawad could play against Gouna after lengthy injury
Ahly's fullback Sayed Moawad could be fit to play against Gouna in the Egyptian League
Sayed Moawad could make his first appearance since November when Ahly host Gouna in the Egyptian League day 8 at the end of this month, the team's doctor Ihab Aly said on Thursday
The talented left winger has been out of action since last November due to a persistant foot injury, depriving Ahly of his rapidity and creativity.
"Sayed Moawad will be able to play against Gouna," Ahly's doctor Aly told the club's official website on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Aly said that team's skipper Hossam Ghaly will start training on 15 May, after ending his rehabilitation program.
The 31-year-old was out of action since last December after undergoing knee surgery to reconstruct his ruptured cruciate ligament.
Ahly are now second in Group A in the Egyptian league with 12 points, three points behind leaders ENPPI but the Red Devils have two games in hand.
