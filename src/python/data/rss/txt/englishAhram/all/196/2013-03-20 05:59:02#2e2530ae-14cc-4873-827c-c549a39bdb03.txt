Film 'Jews of Egypt' to premiere in cinemas on 27 March
Director says authorities have finally given him the green light to screen the film in local cinemas
A documentary about Egyptian Jews is due to be screened in cinemas in Egypt starting 27 March, the film’s director Amir Ramses announced on Twitter and Facebook, on Wednesday.
According to film's producer, Haytham El-Khameesy, Egypt's national security apparatus had delayed the premiere of the movie, initially scheduled for 13 March in three Egyptian theatres: Nile City, Sun City and St. Stefano.
On 12 March, censorship committee director Abd El-Satar Fathi told El-Khameesy that Egypt's security apparatus wanted to see the film again, despite the earlier censorship clearance.
The film has now obtained the necessary clearance to be shown. 
The director spent three years researching and shooting a documentary “that captures fragments of the lives of the Egyptian Jewish community in the first half of the twentieth century until their second grand exodus after the tripartite attack of 1956” according to the film’s website.
