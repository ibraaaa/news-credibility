Shelling from Syria spills into Lebanon
Missiles from Syria land in northern Lebanon but no damage reported
At least three shells and several missiles fired in fighting in Syria landed inside Lebanon on Wednesday, residents and security sources said, but there were no reports of damage or injuries.
"Around 9:00 am (0700GMT), two shells and a rocket fell on the outskirts of the village of Sahlet al-Ma" near the border with Syria, a local security services official told AFP.
The area, in the northern part of Lebanon's eastern Bekaa Valley, is adjacent to Syria's Homs province, the scene of heavy fighting in recent months between rebels and regime forces.
Residents said the missiles had hit near a stone mill, causing no damage or injuries.
Lebanon's official news agency said that five missiles had hit Lebanese territory, and later added that an additional missile had landed in the same area on Wednesday afternoon.
It was the latest incident in which fighting in Syria has spilled over the border.
On Tuesday, President Michel Sleiman slammed as "unacceptable" a series of Syrian air raids a day earlier that targeted sites inside Lebanese territory. Syria denied launching the attack.
