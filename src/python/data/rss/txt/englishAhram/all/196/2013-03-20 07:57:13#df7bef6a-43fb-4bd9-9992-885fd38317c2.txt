Terek fined after Chechen leader calls referee a "donkey"
Terek Grozny will be fined 200,000 roubles ($6,500) and play one match at a neutral venue after Chechnya's leader called the referee a "sellout" and a "donkey" over a loudspeaker during a recent match
Initially it was believed the stadium announcer had insulted FIFA referee Mikhail Vilkov after he sent off a Terek player in Sunday's 0-0 draw against Rubin Kazan, but Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov - Terek's honorary president - said the words were his.
Half of the fine was levied for "failure to provide for public order and security" and the other half for the cry over the loudspeaker and the stadium announcer's comments in favour of Terek during the match, Russian news agencies reported.
Kadyrov entered the referees' room after the match, which is against regulations, and his bodyguards prevented a match delegate from entering for several minutes, R-Sport quoted FA disciplinary committee chairman Artur Grigoryants as saying.
"The (commission) penalises the club, not individuals," R-Sport quoted him as saying.
Terek could have been fined up to 500,000 roubles ($16,300) or incurred sanctions on their new stadium, named after Kadyrov's late father Akhmat, who was assassinated by a bomb blast at the old ground in May 2004.
Critics accuse Kadyrov of ignoring Russian law and running Chechnya like a fiefdom but President Vladimir Putin has relied upon him to rein in rebels and keep order in the mostly Muslim region, still plagued by militant attacks after two wars against separatists seeking to break from Russia.
