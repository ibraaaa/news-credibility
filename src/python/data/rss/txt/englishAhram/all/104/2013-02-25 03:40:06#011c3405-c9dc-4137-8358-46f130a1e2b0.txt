Ismaily to be supported by fans against Algerian Belouizdad
Egyptian security forces will allow small number of fans at Ismaily Arab Cup game set for Wednesday
“Only three thousand fans are allowed to attend. The club and their fans groups will be responsible for any exceeding of the approved number,” read a letter sent from the interior ministry to the Egyptian Football Association (EFA) published on the EFA website Monday.
The match was reportedly under threat of being cancelled as rumours spread that the security authorities would not approve securing the match, even behind closed doors.
The coastal club reached the Arab Cup semis after drawing with the Algerians 1-1 away two weeks ago.
Crowd are banned from attending Egyptian domestic league matches since last year’s Port Said stadium tragedy when bloody clashes between Masry and Ahly fans left more than 70 dead and hundreds injured.
