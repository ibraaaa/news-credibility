South Africa: Oscar Pistorius reports to authorities
Paralympics champions Oscar Pistorius is currently under bail terms for being accused of murdering girlfriend
A spokeswoman for Oscar Pistorius says he has reported to authorities in South Africa's capital, Pretoria, under the bail terms in the murder case against him.
Lunice Johnston said Monday that the double-amputee Olympic athlete visited correctional officers, but she did not specify their location in the city.
Pistorius, who was released on bail Friday, is staying at the home of his uncle, Arnold, in the affluent suburb of Waterkloof in Pretoria.
Pistorius is accused of premeditated murder in the shooting death of his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp, in the early hours of Feb. 14. Prosecutors say the pair had an argument before Steenkamp was killed; Pistorius says he mistook her for an intruder and shot her accidentally.
