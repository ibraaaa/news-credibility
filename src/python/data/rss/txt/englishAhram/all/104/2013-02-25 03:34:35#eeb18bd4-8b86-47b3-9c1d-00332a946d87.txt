Ghana's Muntari crashes in Inter Milan after Barcelona win
Seemingly on roll after their Barce win, Ghana and Milan midfielder Muntari laments a draw with Inter Milan
Ghana and Milan midfielder Sulley Ali Muntari is sullen from the 1-1 draw with Inter Milan in the 26th matchday of the Italy's Serie A on Sunday just after the climax of beating Barcelona in the European Champions League a week before.
"Against Barcelona we really gave all we had and we deserved to win," Muntari was quoted as saying on Supersport.
"It’s a shame that this evening we only got a draw. We should have won for ourselves and for our fans," he lamented.
The 28-year-old attacking midfielder Muntari scored against Barcelona in the 2-0 win over the Spanish giants in the 16th round of the European Champions League last week.
"This jersey is already a part of me; it’s in my blood," Muntari revealed.
Muntari is expected to join the Ghana squad when they play Sudan in March for the World Cup qualifiers. He shone with superb performance for AC Milan this season after recovering from a serious knee injury sustained during the off season that sidelined him for five months.
