Sushi in a 5-star lobby
A new sushi baby hits Cairo; Saki Sushi opens in the amazing lobby of the Fairmont Heliopolis & Towers
The most impressive part of the Fairmont Heliopolis & Towers is a large, half-circle glassed-in area with a ceiling so high it almost reminds you of the great cathedrals of Europe. This modern, space-like expanse embraces decorative columns in the centre with interspersed greenery.
Right in this lobby is the newest addition to the five-star experience: Saki Sushi.
The hotel held their soft opening 13 February to give sushi lovers a pre-opening taste. To get everyone hooked, Saki Sushi offers all-you-can-eat on Wednesdays, 6pm - 12 midnight for LE199, all inclusive.
Red tuna sashimi, salmon nigiri, avocado maki rolls and cones were shuffled out, freshly made before our eyes.
They offer sushi favourites such as Spicy Tuna Roll (LE70), Tempural Roll (LE130), all kinds of sashimi (LE40 for the usual salmon - LE70 for scallops) and temakis (seaweed wraps) for LE45-LE60. Combos range from LE150 - LE325. For Valentines they have a set menu with special pricing.
