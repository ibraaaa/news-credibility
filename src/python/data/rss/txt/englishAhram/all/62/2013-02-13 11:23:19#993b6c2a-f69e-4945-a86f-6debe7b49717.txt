Preview: Striker Abdel-Zaher awaits debut as Ahly face Smouha
Newly-signed striker Ahmed Abdel-Zaher may make his debut in Ahly’s Egyptian Premier League game against Smouha on Thursday
Ahmed Abdel-Zaher may be given the nod to spearhead Ahly’s unproductive frontline when the team face Alexandria-based club Smouha away from home on Thursday.
Ahly signed Abdel-Zaher from ENPPI last month to bolster their attack as they eye an eighth consecutive league title but he is yet to make his debut, with coach Hossam El-Badry still relying on the old guard.
Egypt striker Emad Meteb featured in Ahly’s opening two victories over Ghazl El-Mahalla and Wadi Degla but he failed to impress and was substituted in the second half of both games.
Despite creating plenty of chances against El-Mahalla and Degla, Ahly could only scrape 1-0 wins.
“I was not sad to sit on the bench during the past two games, the league is still in its early stages,” Abdel-Zaher was quoted as saying by local media.
“Some people are saying that Meteb’s presence is causing me problems, and this is not true at all. I’m happy to play with him in the same team. I do not think about my personal interests, what matters is the team’s interests,” he added.
Ahly are second in Group B but they will overtake leaders Bani Suef Telephones, who have seven points, if they beat Smouha.
Smouha, who spent big in the close season to reinforce their squad, made a disappointing start as they could only collect one point from two games.
