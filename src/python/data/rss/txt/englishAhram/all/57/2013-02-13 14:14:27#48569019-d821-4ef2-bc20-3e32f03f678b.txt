Egypt duo Gedo, Elmohamady on target in Hull City win
Gedo opens his account with Hull City while compatriot Elmohamady strikes late to give them a 2-1 victory over Derby County in the English Championship
Mohamed Nagy ‘Gedo’ came off the bench to score his maiden Hull City goal and compatriot Ahmed Elmohamady was also on target as Hull City claimed a late 2-1 victory over Derby County in the English second division (Championship) on Tuesday.
Forward Gedo, who joined Hull from Egyptian giants Ahly on loan until the end of the season, needed two minutes to open the scoring following his second-half introduction.
He broke the deadlock in the 47
th
minute after heading a cross from Robert Brady into the bottom corner of the net. Gedo made his Hull debut in the 2-1 defeat by Brighton last weekend.
"Soo happy for scoring my first goal in my home debut...I love the supporters...unbelievable atmosphere," Gedo, best known for scoring five goals at the 2010 African Nations Cup to steer Egypt to a record-extending seventh title, said on Twitter after the game. 
In-form winger Elmohamady, who is on loan from English Premier League side Sunderland, gave Hull an 87
th
-minute victory after Jamie Ward had equalised for Derby County three minutes earlier.
He headed in from close range following another centre from Brady but was booked for taking his shirt off in celebration of his second goal with Hull since joining last summer.
Egyptian right-back Ahmed Fathi, who also moved to Hull from Ahly, sat on the bench as he is yet to make his debut with the Tigers.
Hull lie second in the Championship table with 56 points, eight behind leaders Cardiff City who have a game in hand.
