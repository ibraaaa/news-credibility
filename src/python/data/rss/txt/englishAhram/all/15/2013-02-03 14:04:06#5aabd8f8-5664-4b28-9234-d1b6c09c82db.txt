Zamalek promise more victories after fine league start
Zamalek deliver 2-0 victory over Ittihad of Alexandria in first league match of season
Zamalek coaching staff and players have expressed satisfaction with their first win in the Egyptian Premier League season.
The team beat Ittihad of Alexandria 2-0 on Saturday.
“The players started the match hesitantly … but they quickly focused and delivered a good performance,” the White Knights' assistant coach Osama Nabih said at the post-match press conference.
The league kicked-off on Saturday after a one-year suspension following the Port Said Stadium disaster that left over 70 Ahly fans dead after a match with rivals Masry.
Versatile midfielder Omar Gaber ended Ittihad’s resistance in the 74th minute, and an own goal by Ittihad’s Mohamed Reda shortly after sealed Zamalek’s victory.
“I really wanted to score but winning is what matters. My teammates played in a very harmonious way,” new Zamalek striker Ahmed Eid said following his first match after joining from Haras El-Hodoud. “Zamalek's winning days are back.”
The Cairo giants have not lifted the domestic trophy since 2004.
