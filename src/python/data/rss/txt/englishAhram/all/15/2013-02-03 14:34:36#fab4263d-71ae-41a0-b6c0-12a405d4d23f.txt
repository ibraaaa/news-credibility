Case challenging constitutionality of Constituent Assembly adjourned
An outstanding case on the constitutionality of the Constituent Assembly that drafted Egypt's new constitution is postponed to March; experts deem the ruling moot
The court is due to rule on Article 1 of Law 97 for 2012 that specifies the criteria by which members of the assembly are chosen and the legality of allowing MPs to select those members.
Last June, the HCC declared the elected People's Assembly (the lower house of Egypt's parliament) null and void after the parliamentary elections law, which regulated legislative polls, was ruled unconstitutional.
The legitmacy of 100 members of the Constituent Assembly appointed by that People's Assembly has been questioned as a result.
