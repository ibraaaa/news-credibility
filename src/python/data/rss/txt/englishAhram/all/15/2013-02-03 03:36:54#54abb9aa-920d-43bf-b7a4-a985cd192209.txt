Assad accuses Israel of seeking to 'destabilise' Syria: SANA
President Bashar al-Assad on Sunday accused Israel of seeking to "destabilise" Syria, four days after an Israeli air raid on a military complex near Damascus, state news agency SANA said.
The raid "unmasked the true role Israel is playing, in collaboration with foreign enemy forces and their agents on Syrian soil, to destabilise and weaken Syria," Assad said during a meeting in Damascus with a top Iranian official.
