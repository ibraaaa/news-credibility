Salafist El-Nour Party rejects calls for Morsi removal and early elections
In a statement released following general meeting held Saturday, El-Nour Party says it is committed to dialogue with the opposition, but rejects demands for early presidential elections
The Salafist El-Nour Party said Sunday it rejects demands echoed by a large number of demonstrators over the past weeks, calling for President Mohamed Morsi to step down, new presidential elections to be held, and for the new constitution to be amended if not abandoned.     
In a press release, the party stated that talks between the presidency, the Freedom and Justice Party (FJP), the Islamist Building and Development Party, Al-Wasat Party, and the main opposition bloc, the National Salvation Front (NSF), and the Ghad Al-Thawra Party, have been successful and are continuing.
A press conference is also expected to be held soon where the outcome of these talks will be announced, particularly concerning efforts to end bloodshed and instability in the country.  
On Saturday evening, El-Nour Party held a general meeting under the leadership of new party head Younes Makhioun and other prominent figures, including heads of provinces, the general assembly, and MP's.
Party spokesperson Nader Bakkar said that during Saturday's meeting, party members reviewed the latest national developments and the success of an initiative it spearheaded to end Egypt's ongoing political crisis.
Bakkar added that during Saturday's meeting other issues discussed included steps to be taken in preparation for parliamentary elections expected in April 2013, and guidelines for potential candidates.
In the latest round of talks held between the NSF and El-Nour Party an
eight-point agreement
was formulated amid violent clashes between police and protesters across the country in the wake of the second anniversary of the January 25 Revolution.
