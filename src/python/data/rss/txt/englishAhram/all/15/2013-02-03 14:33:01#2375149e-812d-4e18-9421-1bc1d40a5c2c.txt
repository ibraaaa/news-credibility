Suez Canal fully secured: Official
Amid trouble in the area, the head of the Suez Canal Authority rubbishes reports that traffic through the strategic passageway will stop and that it might be leased to another country
The Suez Canal is fully secured, navigation through the waterway never halted and is proceeding as usual says Vice Admiral Mohab Mamish and head of the Suez Canal Authority to Al Ahram Arabic daily newspaper.
Furthermore, reports that Egypt might lose sovereignty over the Suez Canal or that the strategic passageway could be leased to a foreign country are completely false, asserts Mamish. On an even more positive note, continues Mamish, Suez Canal revenues will significantly increase, possibly hitting close to $6 billion.
A recent wave of problems in the Suez area raised the fear that traffic would be halted through the strategic shortcut between the East and north Africa/the West.
A Greek ferry docked in Port Said was attacked by unknown gunmen.
Suez saw clashes between civilians and security on 25 January, the second-year anniversary of Egypt's revolution. Clashes broke out again the next day after a court gave 21 Port Said residents the death sentence in the case of violence at a football match that left more than 70 dead.
Most recently, one of the world's largest container ships, Emma Maersk, risked blocking the Suez Canal waterway on Friday when it faced technical difficulties at the Canal's northern entrance. The ship was safely taken out of the way and docked, however.
