Real Madrid's Mourinho praises Granada players
Real Madrid coach believes that Granada players did their job throughout the two side's game in the Spain La Liga
Real Madrid coach Jose Mourinho revealed that Granada deserve the victory over the Spain giants and his team has no excuse for the loss while the foes scored their goal and defended it throughout the game.
"I think the result is fair, there have been too many defeats. Granada did their job," Mourinho was quoted as saying on the club's official website on Sunday.
"They scored their goal, they defended in the second half with all of their heart and soul," he added.
"They have a new coach, new players and had a great night of football here with Real Madrid in front of them,"
Ronaldo scored the first own goal of his otherwise stellar career to condemn Real Madrid to a 1-0 defeat at Granada on Saturday, as Jose Mourinho's side fell into the same funk that has dogged it all season against lesser-name opponents
It is fifth loss for Real Madrid during the ongoing La Liga season while they are 3rd in the league table with 43 points, 15 points behind arch-rival leaders Barcelona who will face Valencia tonight.
"They did everything that they could to get this result. We should have scored a goal but because of the great effort that Granada made, I think that the three points have gone to the team that deserved them." Mourinho concluded.
