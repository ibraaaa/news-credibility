People's stories inspired
Tahrir Monologues

Tahrir Monologues
.
"We loved those casual storytelling moments; we loved them for the hope they gave us, for what they did to remind us of what we were part of, and we loved them most of all for reminding us of what we are capable of," read the statement circulated by the
Tahrir Monologues
crew promoting this event.
The group takes real stories from people on the ground and at home, experiencing current events and act them out on stage, thus preserving and documenting these stories.
The screening will be hosted along with a concert by Ramy Essam, often dubbed "The Revolution's Singer."
