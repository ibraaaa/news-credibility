'Morsi president of Brotherhood, PM a clerk of Guidance Bureau,' Free Egyptians Party
Ahmed Saeed, a leading liberal opposition figure, hits out at the president and prime minister for their silence on recent nationwide clashes
In a statement Sunday, Saeed expressed dismay at the absence of a reaction from the presidency to the recent bloodshed.
Saeed puts the country's malaise down to the fact that President Mohamed Morsi acts as "a president to merely the Brotherhood, rather than to all Egyptians" and that Prime Minister Hisham Qandil "considers himself a clerk working for the [Muslim Brotherhood's] Guidance Bureau."
Saeed went on to claim that if the dozens who lost their lives in recent weeks were in Gaza, the presidency would have reacted.
"The presidency would have issued a statement expressing grief and the prime minister would have gone in person to extend condolences to the families of the victims," Saeed said derisively.
