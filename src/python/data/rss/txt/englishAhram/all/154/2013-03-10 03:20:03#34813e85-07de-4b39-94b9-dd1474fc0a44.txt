Syrian National Coalition postpones meeting to form government
The Syrian National Coalition has postponed a meeting to form a provisional government, in the last setback to opposition efforts to create an administration to take over if President Bashar al-Assad is ousted, coalition sources said on Sunday.
The meeting to elect a provisional prime minister, which was due to be held on March 12 after being postponed once already, has been rescheduled for March 20, but it was uncertain it would be held even then, the sources said.
