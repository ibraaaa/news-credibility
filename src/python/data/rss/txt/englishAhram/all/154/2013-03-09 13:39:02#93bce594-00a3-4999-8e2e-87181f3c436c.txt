Art Alert: Maryam Saleh holds concert in Alexandria to promote CD
Egyptian singer Maryam Saleh promotes her newly-released rock, oriental, funk and triphop fusion CD at Bibliotheca Alexandrina on Wednesday 13 March
Egyptian singer, Maryam Saleh, is set to give her first concert of 2013 at the Alexandria Library on Wednesday 13 March.
The musician was involved in several projects before launching her own album
Ana Mesh Baghani
(I Don't Sing) last year. The album reflects Maryam's personal quest to experiment with different genres of music and the result is a melting pot of rock, oriental, funk and a bit of triphop.
Saleh was one of the founders of Baraka Band in 2008, who covered Sheikh Imam songs setting them in contemporary rock genre. Maryam has long been influenced by the music of Sheikh Imam, who was also a family friend. "He raised me," she told Ahram Online in 2012 prior to one of her performances. "He used to sing in my house, on my birthday. I grew up listening to his music."
Saleh is also a member of an Arabic triphop project with her Lebanese counterpart Zeid Hemdan. Together they mix electro beats with rock.
Programme:
Wednesday 13 March, 8:00pm
