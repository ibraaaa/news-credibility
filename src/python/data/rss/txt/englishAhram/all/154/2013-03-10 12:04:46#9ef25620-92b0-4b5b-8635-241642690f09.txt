Train service resumes in Egypt's Delta after Ultras Ahlawy protests
Protests by Ultras Ahlawy supporters in Banha delay 31 trains on Sunday morning
The Egyptian Railways Authority early Sunday stated that its trains had resumed service normally after 31 were delayed on the Cairo-Alexandria line.
Protesters from the Ultras Ahlawy hardcore football fans in Qalubiya governorate stood on the rail tracks in Banha, halting all train movement.
Clashes erupted nationwide on Saturday after the 
Port Said stadium massacre verdict
was issued. In Cairo, three protesters were killed in clashes with the police, and unknown assailants torched the Police Club in Gezira and the nearby Egyptian Football Association.
