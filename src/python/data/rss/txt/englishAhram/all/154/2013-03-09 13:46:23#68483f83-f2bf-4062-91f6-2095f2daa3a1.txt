Photography in Cairo exhibition challenges the meaning behind 'A7A'
'A7A Portraits' is a ten day exhibition opening in Photopia this Wednesday, aiming to challenge negative connotations to the colloqiual word 'A7a'
Photopia hub for photographers in Cairo hosts a ten day exhibition of Bashir Wagih's
featuring a series of highly stylised portraits of people portraying what the word "A7a" means to them, on Wednesday, 13 March.
The word "A7a" has a negative meaning in Egyptian society, though often people are not sure why it is considered a swear word. The word itself has no origin in the Arabic language, and is entirely colloqiual based.
The most believed theory of the origin of the word was that during the Fatimid era in Egypt the word "to object" (
Ahtag
) was banned, so Egyptians started using the word "A7ta", which later turned into "A7a."
Wagih uses a mixed media installation, relying mostly on photography, to explore the notion and attempt to find alternate meanings.
Programme:
Opening Wednesday, 13 March at 7pm
Photopia, 15 El-Somal Street, behind Vodafone, Korba, Heliopolis, Cairo
