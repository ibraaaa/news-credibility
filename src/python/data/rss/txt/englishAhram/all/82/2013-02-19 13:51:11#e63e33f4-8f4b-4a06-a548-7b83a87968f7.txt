Free-scoring Gedo scores third goal for Hull, Elmohamady also on target
Egyptian duo Gedo and Ahmed Elmohamady score as Hull City beat Blackburn Rovers 2-0 in the English second division
Egypt forward Mohamed Nagy ‘Gedo’ continued his blistering form with his third goal in four appearances as Hull City defeated Blackburn Rovers 2-0 in the English Championship (second division) on Tuesday.
Gedo’s compatriot Ahmed Elmohamady was also on target as Hull’s on-song Egyptian contingent maintained their impressive run.
Egypt’s versatile defender Ahmed Fathi, who like Gedo joined Hull from Egyptian giants Ahly on loan until the end of the season, was introduced in the dying minutes to make his second appearance with the Tigers.
Hull lie second in the Championship table with 62 points, five behind leaders Cardiff City who have a game. The first two will earn direct promotion to the elite Premier League.
Gedo, who found the net in Hull’s 2-1 win over Derby County and scored the winner in their 1-0 victory over Charlton Athletic, opened the scoring seven minutes after the restart with a close-range effort following a cross from Stephen Quinn.
Right wing-back Elmohamady ensured the win in the 67th minute when he superbly volleyed the ball home at the far post, making the most of a cross from Robert Brady.
The 25-year-old, who notched up the winner against Derby County, was voted as man of the match.
