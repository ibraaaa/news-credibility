Egypt's NSF reiterates pre-conditions for dialogue with presidency
National Salvation Front (NSF) repeats its conditions - including delay of upcoming parliamentary polls - for holding talks with Egypt's embattled President Morsi
Egypt's National Salvation Front (NSF) opposition coalition issued a statement on Tuesday afternoon listing its conditions for dialogue with the presidency.
Those conditions include taking "serious steps" towards the prosecution of those responsible for protesters' deaths by assigning judges to investigate such crimes, along with the formation of a new government of national unity.
The NSF also insisted on several previous pre-conditions, including the appointment of a new prosecutor-general in accordance with the constitution and judicial independence; amending Egypt's new constitution; postponing upcoming parliamentary polls; and guaranteeing judicial and international oversight of upcoming elections.
In the same statement, the NSF praised a recent Nour Party initiative aimed at ending Egypt's political crisis, lauding the Salafist party's attempts to "peacefully achieve revolutionary objectives."
The NSF, meanwhile, has denied rumours that former presidential candidate and head of the Egyptian Popular Current movement Hamdeen Sabbahi had withdrawn from its ranks.
