Nigeria’s Moses revels in ‘dream’ achievement
The promising Nigerian forward eyes more glory after helping his side win the Africa Cup of Nations
Victor Moses revels in the ‘dream’ of playing for Chelsea as well as guiding Nigeria to the Africa Cup of Nations title.
The 22-year-old produced some superb displays as the Super Eagles won their third continental title after beating Burkina Faso 1-0 in the final.
“If anybody had told me that I would be playing for Chelsea and winning the Nations Cup by the beginning of this year, I would not have believed it. It is like a dream,” Moses told FIFA.com.
“But it has taken a lot of hard work and I have been working hard week in and week out, and at the end of the day everything came out for me in a positive way.”
Nigeria will play at the FIFA Confederations Cup next summer in Brazil, where they were drawn in Group B of the World Cup’s dress-rehearsal along with world and European champions Spain, Uruguay and Tahiti.
“I am looking forward to playing against [Spain]. It will be wonderful, not just for me, but for the other players as well,” Moses added.
“That we have the chance to play against some of the greatest players in the world is terrific. We are very happy, but the most important thing was to win the Nations Cup. With having actually done that, we are looking forward to Brazil.”
