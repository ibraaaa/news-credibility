Wadi Degla claim first Egyptian Premier League win
Wadi Degla register first league win, Ittihad El-Shorta draw with Talae El-Gaish
Wadi Degla struck late to earn their first Egyptian Premier League win after defeating Gouna 3-2 in an exciting game on Tuesday.
Gouna took the lead via goal from midfielder Ashour El-Adham but Syrian striker Abdel-Fattah Al-Agha leveled the score on the stroke of halftime after converting a penalty before putting Degla ahead on 48 minutes.
Gouna’s Moataz Mahrous restored parity via another penalty but Amr Marei scored with two minutes remaining to help Degla recover from a poor start.
Degla, who offloaded many of their regular players in the off-season, have three points from four games after losing their opening three matches. They lie seventh in Group A.
In Tuesday’s other match, struggling Talae El-Gaish failed to follow in the footsteps of Degla after extending their winless run to four matches following a 1-1 draw with Ittihad El-Shorta.
Adel Belal gave El-Gaish the lead after 19 minutes but El-Shorta’s Khaled Kamar secured a share of spoils nine minutes later.
