Egyptian prosecution to ask Interpol for arrest of ex-PM Shafiq
Former Mubarak-era PM Ahmed Shafiq and his daughters have been referred to trial for embezzling public funds
Dowidar added that this step follows the order of Osama El-Saidi, the prosecutor in charge of an embezzlement case against Shafiq known as the 'pilots' housing' case to refer Shafiq, his three daughters and another ten accomplices for trial for embezzling public funds.
Ahmed Shafiq and his daughters are accused of seizing land that belonged to fish farms and illegally allocating it to the Pilots' Association for Land Development, which he headed.
In June 2012, following his defeat in the presidential elections by Mohamed Morsi, Shafiq and his family left Egypt for Abu Dhabi.
