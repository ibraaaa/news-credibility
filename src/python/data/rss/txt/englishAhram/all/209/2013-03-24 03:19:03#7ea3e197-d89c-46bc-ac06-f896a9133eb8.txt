Egypt's public funds prosecution will summon ousted President Mubarak and ex-PM Nazif to answer charges of receiving illegal 'gifts' from the state-owned 'Gmohoraya' newspaper. 
Public funds prosecutor general, Mostafa El Hosseiny, has ordered state-owned 'Gomhoeraya' to ask key ex-regime figures under Mubarak and Nazif
 for reimbursement for gifts they had received from the newspaper between 2007 and 2011.
 
Mubarak is facing charges of having received almost LE1.4 million in gifts from the state-owned newspaper, while Nazif is accused of receiving gifts worth almost LE200 thousand.
