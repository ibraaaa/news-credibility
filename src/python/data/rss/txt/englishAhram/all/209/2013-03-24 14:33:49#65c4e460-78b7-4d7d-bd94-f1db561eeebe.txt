Egypt court postpones verdict on parliamentary elections
Decision on fate of parliamentary elections delayed to allow presidency, head of Shura Council and justice ministry time to show they had authorised Egyptian State Lawsuit Authority to submit appeal on their behalf
The Supreme Administrative Court (SAC) on Sunday postponed its verdict on appeals against the suspension parliamentary elections until 7 April.
The verdict was delayed to enable the presidency, the head of the Shura Council and the justice ministry time to show they had authorised the Egyptian State Lawsuit Authority to submit the appeal on their behalf.
The appeals were submitted by the Egyptian State Lawsuit Authority on behalf of the presidency, and by former MP Mohamed El-Omda.
The verdict was initially set to come out on 17 March but was postponed.
On 6 March, the Supreme Administrative Court overturned a presidential decree calling for parliamentary elections to begin on 22 April, questioning the constitutionality of the electoral law.
The High Constitutional Court (HCC) had rejected five of the electoral law's articles on 18 February. The law was referred back to the Shura Council, which partially amended the legislation without referring it back to the HCC for final approval. President Mohamed Morsi then issued a decree stating parliamentary polls would be held in late April.
An administrative court ruling said the Shura Council should have referred the electoral law back to the HCC before ratifying it, so as to ensure the amendments were constitutional.
On Sunday, Egypt’s office of state commissioners, a judicial body responsible for issuing non-binding recommendations to the courts, called for the appeals against the suspension of elections to be rejected.
