Kenya coach praises players in Nigeria draw
Coach Amrouche is impressed with his players' 1-1 draw as they faced no less than the African champions, Nigeria
Kenya coach Adel Amrouche reveals that he was impressed with the confidence of his players after the 1-1 draw with Nigeria in the 2014 World Cup qualifying Group F on Saturday.
"Although we did not win the match, I was very impressed by the confidence and the maturity the players showcased against tough opponents like Nigeria," Amrouche told the post-game press conference.
"It was not going to be an easy match at all as we were the underdogs playing against a side that had two months ago been crowned African champions," he added.
Harambee Stars took a surprising lead after 36 minutes, thanks to a goal from Francis Kahata. Then Nations Cups winners Nigeria scored deep in stoppage time to salvage a 1-1 draw at home.
Amrouche lamented dropping two points as Nigeria came from behind to score a dramatic equaliser.
"Football is a dynamic game and at one point in the match I thought we could cause an upset, but a last-minute lapse in concentration affected us when Nigeria equalised.
"We will go back to the drawing board and take stock of our mistakes, but overall I think we took a positive step that will help us in our subsequent matches," Amrouche said.
"Playing a team like Nigeria with so much great talents is never easy, but we had a team plan that I intend to work on," the tactician concluded.
Kenya are in the tail of Group F with two points, three behind the group leaders Nigeria and runners-up Malawi, while Namibia are third with three points.
