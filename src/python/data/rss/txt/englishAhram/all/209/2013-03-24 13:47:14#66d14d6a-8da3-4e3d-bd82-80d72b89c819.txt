Art Alert: Reliving the 90s TV in Egypt
'My Nineties' opening in Townhouse Gallery on 1 April uses several artistic mediums to rediscover Egyptian media and television during the 90s
This multidisciplinary project initiated by visual artist Mohamed Allam, brings together various artists to present several years of research and more than 4000 VHS tapes of footage of Egyptian media and television in the 90s through a book, documentary, performance and exhibition opening on 1 April in Townhouse Gallery.
Tes'eenaty
(My Nineties) is Allam's attempt to dig into Egyptians' collective memory from the last decade and show the audience this excavation in a new setting. Some of the videos will be screened as they are found and others will be remixed to give new meanings. They accompany a book by Hassan ElHalwagy, which includes research on this era, along with newspaper and magazine snippets. A documentary by Emad Maher on the icons of the 90s media industry will also be screened.
Allam and musician Rami Abadir will also put on a live audio-visual performance for the opening night using the exhibition materials.
Allam is a visual artist, mostly working with video and digital arts, and is also a founder of Medrar for Contemporary Arts.
