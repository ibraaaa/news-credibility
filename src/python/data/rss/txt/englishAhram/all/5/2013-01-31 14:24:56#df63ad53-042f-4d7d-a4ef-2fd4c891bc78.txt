Central Bank of Egypt approves deal by Qatar National Bank to acquire majority stake in National Societe Generale Bank - Egypt
Egypt's central bank has approved a request by Qatar National Bank (QNB) to acquire a majority stake in National Societe Generale Bank - Egypt (NSGB).
In a press statement reported on Thursday by state-run news agency MENA, QNB said it had begun legal measures with the Egyptian government to obtain Societe Generale's Egypt unit and expected to make a full acquisition within two months.
QNB presented its offer to acquire NSGB to Egypt's central bank on 19 December 2012.
The leading Qatari bank will pay almost $2 billion its stake.
News of the central bank's approval propelled NSGB's shares, with analysts expecting it to be Thursday's biggest gainer.
