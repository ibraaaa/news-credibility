Morsi cuts short Germany visit due to Egypt violence
Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi cuts short his visit to Berlin and calls off a planned trip to Paris due to ongoing unrest at home
Some observers had criticised the visit, which took place during spiralling violence in three Suez Canal cities and amid calls by the opposition for a national dialogue.
On Wednesday, President Morsi, accompanied by a delegation of business officials, met German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin to discuss German support for the Egyptian economy.
Presidential spokesman Yasser Ali said Morsi had also cancelled a visit to the French capital on Friday in view of the current unrest in Egypt.
"All foreign trips taken by the president are in the interest of Egypt and all Egyptians. The president thinks it is unreasonable to travel as the situation requires him to be at home."
Talking of the president's slated visit to Washington, Ali said the exact date would not to be set until stability was restored in the country. The visit is expected to take place in late February or early March.
