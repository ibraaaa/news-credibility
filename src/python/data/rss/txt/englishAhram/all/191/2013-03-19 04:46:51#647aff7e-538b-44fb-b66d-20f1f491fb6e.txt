Tunisia threatens to suspend Club Africain for president's political activities
Club Africain threatened with suspension from domestic competitions due to political activities of club president, Slim Riahi, who is also president of opposition political party
 
Tunisian giants Club Africain could be suspended from domestic competitions due to the political activities of its president, Slim Riahi.
Riahi is also president of the Free Patriotic Union party which is, according to the government, against Tunisian law to hold both positions at the same time.
Government officials have asked him to leave one of the posts, local media has said.
The move came soon after Riahi voiced opposition to Tunisian President Moncef Marzouki asking him and his government to resign because of their political failure.
Riahi has been combining the two positions for the last two years.
The government gave Riahi 30 days to resign or the club would be suspended from domestic competitions, Radio Mosaique FM reported on Tuesday
In an official statement, Riahi asked club supporters to cancel a planned protest at the government headquarters on Wednesday, insisting he would fight the issue through legal avenues.
The 12-time Tunisian title holders, Club Africain, are top of Group A with 26 points after 12 matches.
