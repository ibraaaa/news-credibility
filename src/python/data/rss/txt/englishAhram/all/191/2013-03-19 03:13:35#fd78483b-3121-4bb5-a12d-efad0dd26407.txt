Egypt coach: World Cup ticket through Africa is tough
American manager Bob Bradley spoke to FIFA about Egypt's chances for the 2014 World Cup
Ahead of Egypt's anticipated clash against Zimbabwe on 26 March, American manager Bob Bradley stated that qualifying for the World Cup through Africa is “tough.”
"The talent across the continent is incredible," Bradley told the FIFA official website in a long interview published in two parts.
"Getting through to a World Cup from Africa is tough, especially when you consider the challenges of travel and the qualification difficulties, which is the reason why it means so much to all Egyptians."
The Pharaohs, winners of a record seven African Cup of Nations, are currently at the top of Group G of the CAF World Cup qualifiers with six points from two games, three ahead of Guinea. Zimbabwe and Mozambique have one point each.
"They won three consecutive Cup of Nations [2006, 2008 and 2010], but they have not been able to reach a World Cup since 1990 and that's the reason it means so much to everyone here."
"The Africa Cup of Nations is an incredible tournament, but I understood the players who said to me that it was all about the World Cup."
The former United States manager also spoke about his dream to coach in Europe.
"At the end of my time with the US, I thought about what would be the next challenge, and it's always been a goal of mine to coach a club team in Europe. And then this opportunity came up, and I could tell it was going to be a great experience. It didn't change the fact that it's still a dream and a goal to coach in Europe."
