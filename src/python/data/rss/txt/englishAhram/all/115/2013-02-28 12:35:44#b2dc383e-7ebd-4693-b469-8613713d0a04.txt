Bangladesh sentences Islamic party leader to death
A special tribunal in Bangladesh has convicted the leader of an Islamic political party of war crimes stemming from the nation's 1971 independence war and has sentenced him to death.
Prosecutor Syed Haider Ali says Islamic Jamaat-e-Islami leader Delwar Hossain Sayedee was found guilty of committing mass killings, rape and atrocities during the nine-month war against Pakistan.
The verdict was announced Thursday by tribunal judge ATM Fazle Kabir.
Lawyers for the defendant boycotted the tribunal during the verdict. Comments from Sayedee's lawyers were not immediately available, but he had previously denied the allegations and said the charges were politically motivated.
Jamaat-e-Islami is enforcing a nationwide general strike Thursday to denounce the trial and to demand he be freed.
