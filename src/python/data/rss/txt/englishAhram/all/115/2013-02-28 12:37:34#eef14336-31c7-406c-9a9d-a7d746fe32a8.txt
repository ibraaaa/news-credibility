Tennis: Nadal reaches quarterfinals in Mexico
Nadal  beats Martin Alund to reach the the Mexican Open quarterfinals
Raphael Nadal took another step in his return from injury Wednesday as the former world No. 1 defeated Argentina's Martin Alund 6-0, 6-4 to reach the Mexican Open quarterfinals.
The second-seeded Nadal needed just 85 minutes to beat Alund at the clay court tournament and will next face another Argentine in Leonardo Mayer, who defeated Russia's Andrey Kuznetsov 6-2, 6-2 to advance.
Top-seeded David Ferrer beat American Wayne Odesnik 6-2, 6-1 to reach the final eight.
Nadal is making a comeback after being away from the tour for more than seven months with a left-knee injury. He made the final of the VTR Open earlier this month in Chile before losing to Argentine Horacio Zeballos. A week later he beat David Nalbandian to claim the Brazil Open title.
