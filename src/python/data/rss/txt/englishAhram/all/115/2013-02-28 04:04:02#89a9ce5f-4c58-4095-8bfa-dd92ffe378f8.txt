UEFA reject Schalke’s protest at Drogba’s Champions League participation
European governing body UEFA rejected Schalke 04's protest that Galatasaray striker Didier Drogba was eligible to play in the first leg of the Champions League round of 16 in Istanbul on Feb. 20
Ivorian striker Drogba joined the Turkish club in late January from Shanghai Shenhua. The Chinese club had initially tried to block the transfer saying he had violated the terms of his contract.
"Having examined all the documents of the case, the Control and Disciplinary Body decided to reject the protest lodged by Schalke," UEFA said in a statement.
