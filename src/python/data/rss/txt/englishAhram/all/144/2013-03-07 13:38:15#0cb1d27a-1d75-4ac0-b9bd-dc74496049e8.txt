160 people arrested in Cairo's Tahrir Square during clashes between anti-government protesters and police on Wednesday night
Clashes between anti-government protesters and police took place in Cairo's Tahrir Square on Wednesday, leading to the arrest of 160 people.
Six of those arrested have been released on bail, Cairo security chief Osama El-Sagheer has said.
Forty people, including 8 minors, were arrested for setting fire to a Central Security Forces (CFS) vehicle and assaulting police officers.
One police officer was shot with birdshot pellets, while dozens of protesters suffered asphyxiation due to teargas inhalation.
Early on Sunday, security forces removed barriers at the entrances to Tahrir Square and evicted anti-government protesters who had been holding an intermittent sit-in in the square since 22 November.
