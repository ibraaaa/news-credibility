Ronaldo hopes Manchester United 'lose every single game'
Former Brazil striker Ronaldo says Manchester United manager Alex Manchester was disrespectful when he made a comment about his weight, saying he was glad United lost to Real Madrid in the Champions League
Ferguson earlier in the week poked fun at the Brazilian's recent weight issues while comparing him with current Real Madrid forward Cristiano Ronaldo.
The Brazilian, who has gotten back in shape, said Wednesday that "Real Madrid shut (Ferguson's) mouth for me."
He said the comment made by Ferguson represented "a lack of respect" and "was not polite" for someone in his position. Ronaldo had already complained of Ferguson's comments on Tuesday.
He said jokingly Wednesday that he has "no more words to this gentleman, just the hope that his team loses every single game it plays."
