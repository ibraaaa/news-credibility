Egypt's midfielder Abd-Rabou still tracked by Anderlecht
Belgian Anderlecht is still interested in signing Egypt and Al-Nasr midfielder Hosni Abd-Rabou
Anderlecht is still interested in signing Egypt and Al-Nasr midfielder Hosni Abd-Rabou despite failing to lure him this winter, the Belgian giants announced on Monday.
Earlier in January, Anderlecht stepped up their interest in signing Abd-Rabou, but they failed to reach an agreement with the Saudi club who insisted on keeping the player until the summer, the end date of his loan spell from Egyptian giants Ismaily.
"We couldn't sign Abd-Rabou this winter but we will contact him again in the summer. He is one of our main targets alongside two other midfielders," Anderlecht's head of transfers department Van Di Maiden was quoted as saying in the Saudi daily newspaper Aleqtisadiah on Monday.
"We had a previous successful experience with Egyptian players. Egypt skipper and Zamalek midfielder Ahmed Hassan played for us before and left a good impression."
"We realise how African players are serious and committed and also that the Egyptian player had a successful career on both the international and club level."
"Abd-Rabou is a good choice especially as we may face the departure of some of our midfielders who are targeted by clubs in Europe. We will offer him a new deal and he will be free to accept it or not," the Belgian club official added.
The 28-year-old star delivered some impressive displays for Ittihad Jeddah last season. He then joined Al-Nasr in the summer on a season-long loan deal.
