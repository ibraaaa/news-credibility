El-Hodoud, ENPPI win at Egyptian league openers
Wadi Degla and Maqassa start their League camping with loss
Haras El-Hodoud beat Wadi Degla 2-1 in their Egyptian Premier League opener on Monday.
The military team had the upper hand early on the first half via goal scored from penalty by striker Ahmed Salama in the 27th
minute. 
Amr Marie scored the equaliser for Wadi Degla in the 45th minute, but a 58-minute goal by Mohamed Halim came to ensure El-Hodoud lead for the game.
Earlier on Monday and also in Group A matches, ENPPI snatched three precious points after defeating Maqassa 2-1.
Both Ahmed Raouf and Abdallah El-Shahat scored for the petroleum club in the 52nd and 90th minutes, while the only goal of Maqassa came from a penalty hit by Fouad Salama on the 74th minute.
The league finally went ahead after a one-year stoppage in the wake of last year’s Port Said disaster, which left over 70 Ahly fans dead following the end of an ill-tempered match against Masry.
