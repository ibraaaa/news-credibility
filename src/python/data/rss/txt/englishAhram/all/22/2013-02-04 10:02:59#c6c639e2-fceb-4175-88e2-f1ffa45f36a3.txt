UN Council vows strong measures over N. Korea nuclear test
The UN Security Council will take "very firm and strong" action against any nuclear bomb test by North Korea, the council president said Tuesday.
Kim Sook, South Korea's UN envoy, said the test appeared "imminent" and that the 15 nation council is "unified" in its determination to take action over what would be "a dangerous attempt to undermine the authority and credibility of the Security Council."
