Despite guiding Togo for their first Africa Cup of Nations' quarter ever, coach Didier Six was severely criticised by striker Emmanuel Adebayor following to Togo's elimination from the ongoing Nations Cup.
Togo's triumphant campaign in Nations Cup was ended on Sunday when the Sparrow Hawks lost to Burkina Faso 1-0 after extra time in the tournament's quarters.
"Our coach wasn't an added value," Adebayor told Radio France international (RFI) on Sunday.
"Me, I was on the Pitch and I couldn't do both jobs at the same time (playing and coaching)."
"I did my best during the game but the truth that he didn't help us," the Tottenham striker added.
Adebayor wasn't the only player who criticised Six, goalkeeper Kossi Agassa had the same opinion of the team's coach.  
Agassa also demanded the Togo football Association make some modifications in the team's technical staff.
