Berlin festival shows Iranian dissident's new film
'Closed Curtain' co-directed by Jafar Panahi debuts at Berlin Film Festival on Tuesday 11 February
A new movie from a dissident Iranian director that defies a ban on filmmaking and reflects his frustration at being unable to work officially is making its debut at the Berlin film festival.
"Closed Curtain" is co-directed by Jafar Panahi and fellow Iranian filmmaker and his longtime friend Kamboziya Partovi. Panahi, who has won awards at several major film festivals in the past, was sentenced to house arrest and a 20-year ban on filmmaking in 2011 after being convicted of "making propaganda" against Iran's ruling system.
Partovi presented the movie Tuesday 11 February at the Berlin festival, where it's one of 19 films competing for the top Golden Bear award.
It's filmed entirely inside a seaside villa, much of the time with curtains drawn, and the two directors are the lead actors.
