Shikabala to return to Zamalek training
Mahmoud ‘Shikabala’ Abdel-Razek is to start training with Zamalek after he ended his loan to Al-Wasl
Egypt midfielder Mahmoud ‘Shikabala’ Abdel-Razek is expected to return to train with his club Zamalek after he ended his loan deal with Emeriti Al-Wasl amicably.
“Shikabala is returning to Cairo and he will join Zamalek’s trainings, but without playing as he is not registered during the winter transfer window,” the player’s agent Samir Abdel-Tawab told the Deutsche Presse-Agentur (DPA) on Tuesday.
The popular forward signed a one-year loan deal with the UAE side last summer following his fallout with former Zamalek coach Hassan Shehata but he has not played with Al-Wasl since his injury on 16 December.
“He can play with Zamalek starting next June when the summer window opens,” Abdel-Tawab added.
The 27-year-old produced a string of strong performances with the club, scoring five goals (four in the UAE league and one in the UAE Cup) and he was instrumental in the team's line-up with Bruno Metsu and Guy Lacombem. However, the club's desire to fortify their squad, who are struggling in the UAE league, pushed management to sign the Brazilian forward.
