CAF's president Hayatou says last term if re-elected
The 66-year-old man, Hayatou, has been in charge of African football governing body for more than 25 years
Long-time Confederation of African Football President Issa Hayatou says it will be his last term if he is re-elected next month in Morocco.
The 66-year-old Cameroonian is currently the only candidate for CAF's presidential election after he brought about rule changes that only allow members of his executive committee to stand.
Hayatou, who has been in charge of African football for more than 25 years, says it will be his last term if he wins, which appears likely.
Jacques Anouma, a member of FIFA's executive committee but not CAF's, wants to stand against Hayatou and is challenging the rule changes at the Court of Arbitration for Sport in Switzerland.
FIFA President Sepp Blatter said Sunday the world football body couldn't intervene and had "nothing to say" about CAF's rule changes.
