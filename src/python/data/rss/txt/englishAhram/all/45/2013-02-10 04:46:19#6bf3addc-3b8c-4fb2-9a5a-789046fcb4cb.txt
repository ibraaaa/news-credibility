Zamalek's Abdel-Malek predicts Egyptian, African league wins
Newly-signed striker Ahmed Eid Abdel-Malek asserts that Zamalek are capable of clinching both Egyptian Premier League and African Champions League titles
"Winning this game was very pleasant, even more than scoring," said former Haras El-Hodoud striker Ahmed Eid Abdel-Malek, who moved to the White Castle last month.
Lone striker Ahmed Gaafar sent a header home with one minute remaining to give the Cairo side their second consecutive win after beating Alexandria's Ittihad last week.
"The team delivered a very satisfactory performance. Both our front- and back-lines were really organised," the 29-year-old Abdel-Malek added.
"The team were very enthusiastic to gain the three points. They played until the very last minute," Zamalek assistant coach Osama Nabih said in televised comments.
The match saw the return of Brazil's Jorvan Vieira, who coached the Whites after a more than two-week absence.
"We're happy with Vieira's return. The good morale will be our motive to win the league and the Africa Champions League this season," Abdel-Malek said.
Zamalek, a popular club in Egypt and the Arab world, has failed to bring home a trophy since 2004's Premier League.
Zamalek currently top Group B with a maximum six points from two games. El-Shorta have three points.
In a new two-group format, the winners of the two groups will advance to play a mini-league, with only home fixtures to determine the champion. The competition is being played behind closed doors at military-owned stadiums due to security concerns.
