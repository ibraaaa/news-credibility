Egypt's El-Hadary reverses international retirement decision
The Egypt goalkeeper backtracks on a surprise decision to retire from international football after a meeting with the Egyptian Football Association chairman on Sunday
Egypt's goalkeeper Essam El-Hadary has reversed his decision to retire from international football, an Egyptian Football Association official said on Sunday.
The veteran guardian was frustrated after Egypt coach Bob Bradley put him on the bench during the 2-1 loss to Chile in a friendly on Wednesday, fielding Ahly's Sherif Ekramy instead.
El-Hadary, who plays for Sudan's El-Merrikh, consequently said he would no longer be available for Egypt selection.
However, he backtracked on his decision after meeting EFA president Gamal Allam and his deputy Hassan Farid on Sunday, an EFA source, who was not named, told Ahram's Arabic sports website.
El-Hadary is widely considered as the best keeper in Egypt's history. He played an instrumental role in steering the team to three consecutive African Nations Cup titles in 2006, 2008 and 2010.
Egypt are preparing their upcoming game against Zimbabwe in the World Cup qualifiers, which will take place next month.
The Pharaohs are leading Group G with six points, three points ahead of second- placed Guinea.
