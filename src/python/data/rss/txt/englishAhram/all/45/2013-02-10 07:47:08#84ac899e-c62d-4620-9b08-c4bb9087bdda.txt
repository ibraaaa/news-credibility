VIDEO: Egypt’s Abou-Treika scores superb goal on Bani Yas debut
The Egyptian playmaker opens his Bani Yas account with a stunning strike in a UAE Cup game on Sunday
Mohamed Abou-Treika marked his Bani Yas debut with a superb goal but his side exited the UAE President’s Cup following a 2-1 defeat by Al-Ain in the quarter-final on Sunday.
The classy playmaker, who joined Bani Yas from Egyptian giants Ahly on loan until the end of the season, played the full 90 minutes and managed to open his account nine minutes past the hour mark.
He met a lay-off from a teammate with a fierce right-foot volley that went into the top corner.
However, Bani Yas conceded a goal in the 75th minute to bow out of the tournament.
