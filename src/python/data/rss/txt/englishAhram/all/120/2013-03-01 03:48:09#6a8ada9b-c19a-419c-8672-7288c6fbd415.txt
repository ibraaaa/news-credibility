Veteran midfielder Giggs, 39, extends Manchester United contract
Ryan Giggs signed a 12-month extension to his contract at Manchester United on Friday, taking his Old Trafford career into a 24th year and ensuring the midfielder will continue playing into his 40s
''I am feeling good, enjoying my football more than ever and, most importantly, I feel I am making a contribution to the team,'' Giggs said.
The 39-year-old Giggs will make his 1,000th senior appearance if he plays for United - the only club in his extraordinary career - against Norwich in the Premier League on Saturday.
Having reverted from a winger to a central midfielder, the Welshman remains an important member of Alex Ferguson's squad.
''What can I say about Ryan that hasn't already been said?'' Ferguson said. ''He is a marvelous player and an exceptional human being.
''Ryan is an example to us all, the way in which he has, and continues to, look after himself ... Ryan seems to reach a new milestone every week and to think that he now has 23 unbroken years of league goals behind him is truly amazing in the modern-day game.''
Giggs has played 931 matches for United, 64 times for Wales and made four appearances for Britain at the London Olympics last year.
He has scored 168 goals in his career for United, including five this season.
Giggs is already the most decorated player in British football history and is set to win his 13th league title, with United 12 points ahead in the Premier League with 11 games left.
He has also won four FA Cups, three League Cups, two Champions Leagues, one UEFA Super Cup, an Intercontinental Cup and a FIFA Club World Cup.
