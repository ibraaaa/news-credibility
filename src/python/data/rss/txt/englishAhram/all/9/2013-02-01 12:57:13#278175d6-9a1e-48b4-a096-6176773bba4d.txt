25 women were sexually assaulted during protests in Tahrir Square, UN official reveals
U.N. officials deplored reports that 25 women were sexually assaulted during protests in Cairo's Tahrir Square and demanded that Egyptian authorities take steps to bring the perpetrators to justice.
The executive director of the U.N. Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women said the agency "is deeply disturbed by the gravity of recent attacks against women." Michelle
Bachelet called on Egyptian authorities to protect women and punish those responsible for the attacks.
The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights says that about 25 women were reportedly sexually assaulted during demonstrations in Tahrir in recent days.
High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay says she deplores the attacks and the fact that authorities have failed to prevent them or bring the perpetrators to justice.
