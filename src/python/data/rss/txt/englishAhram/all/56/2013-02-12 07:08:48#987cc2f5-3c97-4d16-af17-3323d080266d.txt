Ahly fans mock Mido’s fitness over Abou-Treika tweet
Ahmed ‘Mido’ Hossam stirs controversy on Twitter after he 'mocks' Abou-Treika
Former Zamalek striker Ahmed Hossam ‘Mido’ has been heavily criticised over a comment about Ahly’s Mohamed Abou-Treika.
“How could you dare mock Abou-Treika? Look at your belly” said an Ahly fan on Twitter on Tuesday. “Let’s begin the ‘party’ for Mido” another fan wrote, before hundreds joined in the mockery.
Mido has played for Tottenham, Ajax Amsterdam, Roma, Marseille and other European clubs. Abou-Treika is currently on loan at UAE’s Bani Yas.
“I am watching the great love story between Abou-Treika and Amoury in the Emirates. I wonder how it will end,” Mido, 29, wrote on Twitter on Tuesday afternoon.
Minutes after his tweet, Ahly fans started to make fun of Mido's lack of fitness, linking their comments in an Arabic-language hashtag that can be translated as “Mido’s paunch.”
Abou-Treika has put in some fine appearance with Bani Yas, especially against Al-Ain when he combined with UAE star Omar Abdel-Rahman ‘Amoury’.
Mido has made controversial comments lately through 
his Twitter accounts
, including comments over Barcelona’s Lionel Messi's suit when he received the Ballon D'Or, media coverage on the move of Ahly duo Ahmed Fathi and Mohamed Nagi ‘Gedo’ to English Championship side Hull City, and continued comments against Zamalek chairman Mamdouh Abbas.
Out-of-action Mido, joined Barnsley last summer after spending an 18-month spell at his home club Zamalek in Egypt, but due to lack of fitness he only appeared once with the Tykes.
Before Barnsley decided to end Mido’s spell amicably,
 he had reportedly faced complications with the club after tweeting against Israel.
