French archaeologist found dead in Cairo apartment
60-year old archaeologist who worked at Cairo's French Archaeological Institute is found dead on Monday; Authorities suspect foul play
Egyptian officials are investigating the death of a French archeologist who was found dead in his Cairo apartment on Monday.
Police officials said Tuesday that there were no signs of forced entry into the apartment of 60-year-old Michel Wuttmann, who had worked at the French Archeological Institute in Cairo.
Wuttmann's body was found with injuries around his mouth, according to investigators, who said he appeared to have been smothered to death. Investigators added that the dead man's cell phone and laptop computer – but no money – appeared to have been stolen.
Speaking on condition of anonymity, police sources voiced suspicion that two young men who visited Wuttmann on Monday night may have been involved in the archaeologist's death.
In a statement posted on its official website, the French Archeological Institute expressed its condolences.
