Shikabala slated to play with Zamalek this season
Cairo giants to invoke FIFA's Article 6 in hopes of signing Shikabala after closure of this season's transfer window, following star forward's release from UAE side Al-Wasl
Cairo giants Zamalek are seeking an exception from FIFA to register forward Mahmoud Abdel-Razek 'Shikabala' after the closure of this season's transfer window.
"Zamalek will contact FIFA through the Egyptian Football Association (EFA) to register Shikabala according to article 6 of FIFA regulations, as the termination of his loan contract with the UAE's Al-Wasl would prevent him from playing this season," reads a statement on the Cairo-based club's official website.
The popular forward signed a one-year loan deal with the UAE side last summer, but the Gulf side ended his spell in amicably in late January.
Article 6 of the FIFA regulations states: "Players may only be registered during one of the two annual registration periods fixed by the relevant association. As an exception to this rule, a professional whose contract has expired prior to the end of a registration period may be registered outside that registration period."
It continues: "Associations are authorised to register such professionals provided due consideration is given to the sporting integrity of the relevant competition. Where a contract has been terminated with just cause, FIFA may take provisional measures in order to avoid abuse."
The 27-year-old Shikabala produced a string of strong performances with the club, scoring five goals (four in the UAE league and one in the UAE Cup) and was instrumental in the team's line-up with Bruno Metsu and Guy Lacombem. However, the club's desire to fortify their squad, who are struggling in the UAE League, pushed management to sign the Brazilian forward.
