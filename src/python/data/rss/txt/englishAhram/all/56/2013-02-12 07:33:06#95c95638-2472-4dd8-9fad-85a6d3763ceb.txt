Egyptian stock market climbs as protests ebb
Main EGX30 index gains 1.1 per cent as turnover picks up
Egypt's bourse was back in the green on Tuesday, as main index EGX30 rose by 1.1 per cent, closing at 5,756 points. The broader-based EGX70 registered a higher increase of 1.9 per cent.

Nationwide anti-government protests were scheduled on Monday, in commemoration of the second anniversary of former president Mubarak's resignation. Investors had been nervous about the marches turning violent, but in the event the turnout was low, with limited skirmishes between protesters and security forces near the presidential palace in Cairo.
Egyptians were net buyers, to the tune of LE45.6 million, while foreign investors net-sold LE35.8 million worth of shares.
