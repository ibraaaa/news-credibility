Togo's Adebayor fined for late return
Togolese striker Emmanuel Adebayor was fined by Tottenham's coach after his late return from international duty
Tottenham's boss Andre Villas-Boas confirmed on Monday that Spurs' Togolese striker Emmanuel Adebayor has been punished due to his late return from Nations Cup.
Adebayor, whose mission with Togo ended on Sunday 3rd February after Togo's elimination from the Nations' Cup quarter-finals, has stayed at home longer than scheduled.
The 28-year old joined Tottenham's camp on Friday, a few hours before Newcastle's clash on Saturday, which forced Villas-Boas to leave him on the Bench.  
 "It is done, we won't talk about it publicly," Andre Villas-Boas told Sky Sports on Monday.
"He arrived on Friday around 6 o'clock, landed in Luton. So he joined the team in the hotel."
"He was supposed to come back before Friday," he concluded.
Adebayor is a key player in Villas-Boas' squad playing 15 matches in the Premier League.
