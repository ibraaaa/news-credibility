Protesters block entrance to Cairo's Mogamma for second day
Administrative building in Cairo's Tahrir Square closed for second day due to anti-Muslim Brotherhood protest
Dozens of anti-Muslim Brotherhood protesters have blocked the entrance to the Mogamma administrative building in Cairo's Tahrir Square for a second day.
Hundreds of people who arrived to deal with administrative issues, such as visas and the processing of official paperwork, condemned the protest.
On Sunday, protesters erected barriers and barbed wire at the building's entrance.
Meanwhile, protesters opposing Morsi's constitutional declaration issued last November are still holding their sit-in in the square.
Marches are expected to head to Tahrir Square on Monday to mark the second anniversary of the ousting of Hosni Mubarak.
Protesters will also march to the presidential palace to voice their objection to President Mohamed Morsi and his government.
