Hull boss awaits improvement from Egypt's Gedo, Fathi
Steve Bruce hopes his new Egyptian signings can get up to speed quickly despite playing few competitive games over the past eight months
Hull City coach Steve Bruce included Egyptian striker Mohamed Nagi 'Gedo' in his squad for the match with Brighton even though he had not played many competitive matches for eight months.
Egypt and Ahly midfielder Ahmed Fathi and striker Mohamed Nagi 'Gedo' joined Hull City on a six-month loan deal during the January transfer window.
Gedo made his debut as a 70th-minute substitute during the 1-0 loss to Brighton in the English Championship, but Fathi was left out of the squad.
"Can they (Gedo and Fathi) get up to speed quickly?" Bruce asked on Monday.
"They haven't played any competitive football for eight months apart from internationals, and they have been friendlies in the main," he added.
The Tigers are bidding to book a place in the English Premier League. They are fourth in the second tier with 53 points.
The Egyptian Premier League was suspended for a year after 72 Ahly fans were killed in the Port Said stadium disaster in February 2012. The new season started two weeks ago.
