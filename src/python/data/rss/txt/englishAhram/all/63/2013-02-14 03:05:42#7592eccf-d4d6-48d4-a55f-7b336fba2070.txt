Their opponents, who exceeded expectations by reaching the final, stayed outside the top 50 but have jumped 37 places to 55th.

The win took England up two places to fourth.
South America showed their strength-in-depth as Venezuela climbed 10 places to 45th, leaving all of the continent's 10 teams in the top 50.
