Tahrir Mogamaa reopens Thursday after 4-day blockade
The main government administrative building in Cairo reopened Thursday after anti-Muslim Brotherhood protesters blocked its entrance Sunday protesting against Brotherhood rule
Hundreds have arrived to the Mogamaa, the country's largest administrative building, in Cairo's Tahrir Square after it reopened Thursday.
Earlier on Sunday, dozens of anti-Muslim Brotherhood protesters blocked the entrance to the building, effectly closing it.
The protesters, who say they want an end to "Brotherhood rule" and to "push forward the goals of the revolution," erected barriers and barbed wire at the entrance, arousing anger among some members of the public trying to enter.
