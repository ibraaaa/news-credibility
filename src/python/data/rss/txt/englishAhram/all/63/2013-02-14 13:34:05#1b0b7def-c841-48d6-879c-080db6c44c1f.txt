The Salafist Al-Asala Party has said it supports the goals of Friday's 'together against violence' rally at Cairo University, but it will not participate.
In a statement posted on its Facebook page, the party explained it did not want to increase tensions between political factions in the country.
It also expressed concerns about the violence and harassment that has plagued recent protests.
Moreover, it said there were forces in the country trying to provoke the Islamist current.
