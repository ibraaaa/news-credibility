On Jan. 28, 2004, Pistorius ran his first competitive race for his school, completing the 100 meters in 11.72 seconds. The Paralympic record at the time was 12.20 seconds.
Paralympics:
At his first Paralympics in 2004, Pistorius won gold in the 200 and bronze in the 100. Four years later, he won gold in the 100, 200 and 400. He also won the 400 and 4x400 relay at the 2012 Paralympics, and took silver in the 200.
Able-Bodied competition: Pistorius competed against able-bodied runners in South Africa, but he was banned from running in IAAF events by the sport's governing body. In 2008, he won a court case that allowed him to run in major races, but he failed to run the qualifying time to compete at the 2008 Beijing Olympics.

Pistorius ran in the 400 and 4x400 relay at the 2011 worlds in Daegu, South Korea. He reached the semifinals in the 400, and helped his team reach the final in the relay.

Pistorius was again on the South African team for the Olympics, running in the 400 and 4x400 relay. He finished second in his opening heat and reached the semifinals, but then finished eighth and was eliminated. In the relay, South Africa was at first knocked out after a collision with Kenya before Pistorius even received the baton to run. But South Africa was later reinstated as a rare ninth team for the final after an appeal disqualified the Kenyans. With Pistorius running the anchor leg in the final, the team finished eighth.
