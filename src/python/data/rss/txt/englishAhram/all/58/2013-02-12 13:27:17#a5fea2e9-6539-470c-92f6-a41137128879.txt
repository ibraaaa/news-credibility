Egypt culture minister retracts resignation
Saber Arab returns to his job as culture minister to 'preserve unity and integrity' of ministry until fresh parliamentary elections or completion of national dialogue
Culture Minister Saber Arab has retracted his resignation in order to "preserve the unity and integrity of the ministry." 
Arab resigned on 4 February without giving a reason. Media reports have said it was in protest at the assault on Hamada Saber, the protester stripped and beaten by security forces outside the presidential palace, and due to the ministry's financial crisis.
In the press statement on Tuesday, Arab said he would remain culture minister until parliamentary elections, probably in April, or until the national dialogue reaches a consensus.
