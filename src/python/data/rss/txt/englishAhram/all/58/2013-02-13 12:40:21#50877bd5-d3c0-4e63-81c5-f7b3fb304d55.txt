VIDEO: Hull City coach praises Egypt duo Gedo and Elmohamady
Steve Bruce is confident Egyptian trio of Gedo, Fathi and Elmohamady will play a big part with Hull City this season
Hull City coach Steve Bruce has praised Egypt duo Mohamed Nagi 'Gedo' and Ahmed Elmohamady after their outstanding performances in Tuesday's 2-1 win over Derby County.
Gedo opened his account with the Tigers just minutes after coming on as a substitute in the second half, while countryman Elmohamady, who is on loan from Sunderland, scored a late winner to lift the team to second place in the Championship table.
"The boy Gedo showed his class. He's an international footballer and I think he's got 19 goals in 30 games so we know he has got quality," Bruce was quoted as saying by Skysports on Wednesday.
"A big credit goes to our chairman. He's worked wonders to get him here," he added.
Gedo and his Ahly teammate Ahmed Fathi joined Hull City on a six-month loan deal during the January transfer window.
Gedo made his debut as a 70th-minute substitute during Saturday's1-0 loss to Brighton in the English Championship, but Fathi is yet to play.
"I didn't think it would be possible to get two international footballers on loan, and Fathi will be a big player for us too," said Bruce.
"We don't think they are a big footballing nation but they are and they have always been a really good team.
"We've got three of them (Egyptians) at the moment and they'll play a big part. I'm convinced of that.
"Ahly play in front of 75,000 every week. They're the Manchester United of Africa, so it's no surprise that they (Gedo and Fathi) are good players.
"Obviously they've got to adapt to England but they are good players - simple as that," the coach concluded.
