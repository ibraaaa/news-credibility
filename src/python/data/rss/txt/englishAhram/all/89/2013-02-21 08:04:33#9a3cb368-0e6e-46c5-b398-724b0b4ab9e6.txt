Mali jihadist group MUJAO says sent fighters to Gao
One of the main Islamist armed groups in northern Mali said Thursday it had sent fighters back into Gao, a city it controlled for nine months before French and Malian troops recaptured it last month.
"Our fighters entered Gao on Wednesday," Abu Walid Sahraoui, a spokesman for the Movement for Oneness and Jihad in West Africa (MUJAO) told AFP.
