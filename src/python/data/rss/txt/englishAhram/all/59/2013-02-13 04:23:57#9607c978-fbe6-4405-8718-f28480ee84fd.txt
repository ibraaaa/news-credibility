One hundred and seventy-four policemen have lost their lives since the January 25 Revolution, Egypt's interior ministry stated on its official Facebook page on Wednesday.
According to the ministry, this figure includes 33 police officers, 46 conscripts, five patrolmen and 77 other security personnel.
Hundreds of Egyptian protesters were reportedly killed during the 18-day uprising in early 2011.
There is no official figure, however, for the number of protesters killed during and after the popular uprising that led to the ouster of former president Hosni Mubarak.
Since the revolution's second anniversary last month, Egypt has been gripped by political violence that has left at least 59 dead and hundreds injured.
