English police investigate Diouf racist abuse case
Man arrested after racist abuse directed at Senegal striker El Hadji Diouf during Championship match between Leeds and Millwall
English club Millwall says a man has been arrested following a police investigation into racist abuse at a soccer match against Leeds last year.
Television footage showed Leeds forward El Hadji Diouf, a former African player of the year, being subjected to racist chants and taunts throughout the League Championship game on Nov. 18.
Millwall says Gerrard Scanlon, a 53-year-old driver from north London, has been charged with a racially aggravated public order offense. He has been released on bail and will appear in court on Feb. 27.
The club says that ''police investigations are ongoing in the light of recent evidence made available to them.''
