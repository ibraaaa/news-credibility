Art Alert: Diab brothers open call for 'Aflamgeya' film workshop
Diab brothers filmmakers open a call for participants in their film arts workshop 'Aflamgeya' in April at El-Sawy Culturewheel
Egyptian director Mohamed Diab, along with his brother screenwriter Khaled Diab and filmmaker friend, Amr Salama open a call for their upcoming workshop entitled
(Movie Lovers) at El-Sawy Culturewheel from 25-27 April.
The three-day workshop is open to anyone interest in films and who wants to explore its different disciplines, not excluding anyone on the basis of educational background or age.
Aflamgeya
is designed by the Diab brothers to introduce participants to the different film arts. The brothers stand firmly by one major condition for applying to their upcoming workshop: no politics.
"Participants are not to discuss politics at all during the workshop or present their project based on a political point of view. Those who do will be disqualified," reads the unequivocal statement on their Facebook page.
Applicants are to submit two "exercises," reads the statement, picture shots that describe both of the following concepts: a person tries to change another person, but refuses to change him/herself; or someone falling in love with another person. According to the brother's statment, "Regardless of age or gender, everyone is encouraged to build characters and a story out of both concepts."
The other part of the project is to submit a one-page drama or comedy scene; the choice is up to the participant. They specify applicants must use font size 14 points when writing.
Additionally, the Diab brothers advise all applicants to watch the following films, since they will be discussed during the workshop:
Training Day
,
Little Miss Sunshine
,
The Departed
,
Barton Fink
and
Reservoir Dogs
.
For more information, please contact Aflamgeya@gmail.com. Deadline for applications is 1 April.
