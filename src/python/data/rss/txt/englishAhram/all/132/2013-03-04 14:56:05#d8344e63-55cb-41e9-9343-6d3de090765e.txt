Culture minister to hold urgent meeting for increase in arts budget
Culture Minister Saber Arab reveals plans for an urgent meeting with Finance Minister Hegazy to re-instate 10% of the arts and culture budget
Culture Minister Mohamed Saber Arab reveals his plans to set an urgent meeting with Finance Minister El-Morsi Hegazy to demand a budget increase of 10 percent for arts and culture activities.
Addressing the media during his visit to the renovated Aisha Fahmy Palace in Zamalek, Arab revealed that the antiquities ministry gave this 10 percent by a law that was recently cancelled. According to Al-Ahram Arabic news site, the culture ministry really depended on these funds.
Saber Arab asserts that these funds will go directly to the Cultural Development Fund to re-fund and re-invest in arts and culture activities "as was the case before. Today it is completely out of money and can't achieve the ministry's plans."
The Aisha Fahmy Palace has been undergoing major renovations for over three years and is scheduled to be completed by May. The  building will include art museums, conference spaces and workshops.
