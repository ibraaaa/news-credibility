Holocaust survivor saved by Schindler writes book
One of the youngest Holocaust survivors saved by Oskar Schindler has a book deal, for a manuscript completed shortly before he died.
Leon Leyson's "The Boy On the Wooden Box" will be published by Atheneum on Aug. 27, the publisher announced Monday. According to Atheneum, the book will provide an "unprecedented perspective" on Schindler, the German industrialist credited with helping to save more than 1,000 Jews during World War II. His story was immortalized in Steven Spielberg's Oscar-winning "Schindler's List."
Leyson became a popular speaker who traveled nationwide to tell his story of life under the Nazis. He was 13 when Schindler rescued him from a Polish ghetto. He settled in California after the war and died at age 83 in January, the day after Atheneum received his manuscript.
