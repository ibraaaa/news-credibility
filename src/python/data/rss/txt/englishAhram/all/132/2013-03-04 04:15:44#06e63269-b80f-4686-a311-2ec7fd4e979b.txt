Closer Iran-Egypt ties about tourism, not religion: Tourism ministry
Despite Salafist protests against normalisation with Shia Iran, Egyptian tourism ministry hopes to bring new wave of Iranian tourists to Egypt

In a press statement, the coalition demanded President Morsi re-freeze relations with Iran, as they could threaten Egypt's national sovereignty and spread the Shia sect in the predominantly Sunni country.
