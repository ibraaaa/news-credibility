Egypt's Koka scores to rescue Rio Ave in Portuguese League
Egyptian striker Ahmed Hassan 'Koka' scores the equaliser for Rio Ave against Nacional de Madeira on Sunday in the Portuguese League
Rio Ave's striker Ahmed Hassan 'Koka' continued his impressive performances in the Portuguese League after scoring his fifth goal of the competition in Rio Ave's 1-1 draw with Nacional de Madeira on Sunday.
The Egyptian striker converted a penalty with 12 minutes remaining to cancel out Claudemir's 20-minute opener for Nacional de Madeira via another spot-kick.
The 20-year-old is set to play with Egypt in the first round of the upcoming U-20 African Championship that will begin in Algeria on 16 March. However, he would not be available for selection if the young Pharaohs reached the second round due to his club commitments.
