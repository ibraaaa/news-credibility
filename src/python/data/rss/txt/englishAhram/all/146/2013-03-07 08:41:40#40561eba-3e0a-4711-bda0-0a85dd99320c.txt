Ivory Coast's Kolo Toure could win new Man City contract
Ivorian defender Kolo Toure might clinch fresh contract following excellent showings in Manchester City's last three games
The 32-year-old Toure, who played in the absence of team skipper Vincent Kompany, gave strong performances against Leeds in the FA Cup and against Chelsea and Aston Villa in the Premier League.
The strong showings have apparently convinced Mancini to consider offering the player – whose contract will expire this summer – a one-year extension deal.
"I'm also leaving in the summer, on holiday," Mancini was quoted as saying by Sky Sports on Thursday.
"We don't know at this moment [about a new deal for Toure]. What's important is that he continues to play the way he did on Monday night and against Chelsea," he added.
The coach went on: "Kolo is a really professional player and deserves to have the satisfaction of these performances. He has done really well, so we'll see."
Toure lost his place on Man City's squad last season after being tested positive for banned substances. He has yet to regain his place, making 13 appearances this season.
