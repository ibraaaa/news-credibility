Egyptian police protest in Sinai, Cairo demanding weapons
Police officers in Sinai take a stand against 'inhumane' working conditions while others in Cairo block off major road in protest
Dozens of police officers across different directorates in Sinai are on strike for the second day in a row.
This includes officers in the directorates of Tour Sinai, Ras Sidr, Taba and Saint Catherine.
Security personnel are protesting against what they describe as "inhumane and degrading" working conditions.
They also demand that low-ranking officers and employees be armed so that they can defend themselves from the recurring dangers they are exposed to while on duty.
The officers claim that their lives are in danger as ministry leaders refuse to allow them access to weapons, urging them to maintain self-restraint. They also demand to be awarded excellence bonuses on a regular basis.
The officers said that they would be suspending work until their demands are fulfilled.
In Cairo, dozens of police officers from the Old Cairo Police Directorate blocked off Salah Salem Street, a major thoroughfare leading to Cairo International Airport, early on Tuesday, bringing traffic flow to a complete halt.
The officers were angry at the death of a fellow officer who died in the line of duty as he attempted to stop a bank robbery. They are demanding more access to live ammunition to defend themselves.
Security forces managed to coax protesting officers into reopening the road to traffic.
