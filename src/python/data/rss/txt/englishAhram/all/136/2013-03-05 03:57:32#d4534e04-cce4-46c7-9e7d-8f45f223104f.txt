Egypt’s El-Hadary may not return to Sudan
What some say is Egypt's best-ever goalkeeper, El-Hadary, left Sudan for Egypt after an odd conflict with his club Merreikh
Goalkeeper Essam El-Hadary returned to Egypt after complications with Merreikh officials regarding his stay in Sudan.
"After El-Hadary returned to Sudan from Saudi Arabia [after performing
umrah
, a minor pilgrimage in Islam], El-Hadary found that Merreikh canceled his hotel reservation. After he communicated with the club, he took his luggage angrily and flew to Egypt," reported Sudanese newspaper GoanSport Tuesday.
"I got the confirmation from the technical staff before I headed to Saudi Arabia. I even paid the room rental, but the hotel management said I need to get an agreement from Merreikh to stay there," the 40-year-old goalie told Egyptian media adding: "I want my rights. I will not keep silent and I will take this further."
From their side, the club’s board reportedly told Sudanese media that the player is pressuring them with demands, although they give him all his benefits.
The former Ahly, Zamalek, Ismaily and FC Sion keeper, El-Hadary, who is widely considered Egypt’s best-ever goalkeeper, returned to Merreikh in the summer after terminating his contract with Egypt’s Ittihad of Alexandria in the wake of attacks on fans in Egypt's Port Said stadium that left more than 70 dead.
