Jansen and Herrmann get Germany callups for Kazakhstan
Germany called Patrick Herrmann and Marcell Jansen for Kazakhstan World Cup qualifiers
Midfielders Patrick Herrmann and Marcell Jansen have received late Germany callups for their World Cup qualifier against Kazakhstan on Tuesday to compensate for a string of injuries and suspensions, a team statement said.
Germany, who beat Kazakhstan in Astana 3-0 on Friday, will be without suspended Bastian Schweinsteiger and injured Julian Draxler when the two sides meet again in Nuremberg.
Coach Joachim Loew had already seen several other players miss out through injury including Toni Kroos, Mats Hummels and Miroslav Klose.
Hamburg SV's Jansen, who has won 36 caps, last played in September 2010 while Borussia Moenchengladbach winger Herrmann, who was on duty with the Under-21 team, has yet to make his senior debut.
Germany are top of 2014 World Cup qualifying Group C with 13 points from five games with Sweden second on eight from four matches.
