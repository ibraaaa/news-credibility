Egyptian star Mohamed Abou-Treika scored his second goal in as many appearances with Bani Yas as they crushed Dubai FC 5-0 in the United Arab Emirates' professional league on Friday.
The classy playmaker, who joined Bani Yas from Egyptian giants Ahly on loan until the end of the season, played the full 90 minutes and managed to score his side's fourth goal in the 72 minute.
The 34-year-old got on the scoresheet when he arrowed a free kick into the bottom corner of the net.
Bani Yas moved to third spot in the league table with 31 points.
Last Sunday, Abou-Treika scored on his debut for Bani Yas in a domestic cup game.
