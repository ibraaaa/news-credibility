Egypt's Ahly snub Cameroonian Medrano Tamen
Coach Badry isn't impressed by Tamen, only looks for the 'best'
Cameroonian midfielder Medrano Tamen failed to convince Ahly's technical staff to lure him when the transfer window reopens next summer.
"We thank Tamen for the time he spent with us but we are only looking for the best," coach Hossam El-Badry told reporters after a friendly game held on Monday.
Ahly are looking to strengthen their midfield especially after the lengthy injury of skipper Hossam Ghali.
Tamen made a big impact with Nigerian side Sunshine stars leading them to the 2012 African Champions League semis before succumbing to future champions Ahly.
The 26-year old player has been a free agent since last December and had a trial period at the Red Devils over the past 10 days.
He played in Ahly's friendly 4-1 win over Bahtim on Monday but his spell came to an end.
