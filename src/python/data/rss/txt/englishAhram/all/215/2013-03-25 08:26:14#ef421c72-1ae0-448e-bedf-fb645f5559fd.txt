Zamalek's African test against DR Congo brought forward
The Whites face a tough challenge away against DR Congo's Vita Club in the second leg of African Champions League round of 32
Zamalek's anticipated match against DR Congo's Vita Club will be played one day earlier than planned, the Cairo giants announced on Monday.
The Whites were supposed to be hosted by Vita Club on 7 April in the second leg of African Champions League round of 32, but the Congolese side decided to change the time and informed Zamalek of the new date.
Zamalek edged one step closer to the prestigious African tournament round of 16 after claiming a narrow 1-0 victory over DR Congo's Vita Club on 15 March.
Zamalek is also flourishing on the domestic level after making their best league start since 2003 to become top of Group B in the competition's new format with a maximum 21 points from seven games, three ahead of nearest challengers Ismaily.
The 11-time Egyptian league winners are bidding to win Africa's elite club competition for the first time since 2002.
