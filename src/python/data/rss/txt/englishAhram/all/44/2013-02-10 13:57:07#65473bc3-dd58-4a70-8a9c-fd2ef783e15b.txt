Ghana will be more experienced next time: Coach
Ghana coach says confidently his young team will be better next time, learning from their 3-1 loss in the CAN third-place play-off against Mali
Ghana coach Kwesi Appiah defends his players, saying they did their best throughout the game against Mali in the 2013 African Cup of Nations third-place play-off, hinting that their loss is simply a matter of lack of experience in the league.
Mali defeated Ghana 3-1 to finish third in the African Cup of Nations on Saturday, overcoming the Black Stars for the second consecutive year in the consolation match.
"I personally believe they performed very well. It is unfortunate," Appiah told the post-match press conference.
"When you have your chances and don’t take them, that is where sometimes you see experience and those coming up," he added.
The Black Stars coach also insists that the players will improve in the coming championships since gaining more experience during this year's African Champions League.
"I have so many young players on the team... [but] I believe they will do well whenever they are given this opportunity again because, by then, they would have had experience in playing in competitions," the tactician concluded.
Ghana is set to face Sudan in the World Cup qualifiers in March.
