Anti-Brotherhood protesters block entrance to Tahrir's Mogamma
Barbed wire and barriers erected by anti-Muslim Brotherhood protesters prevent opening of Egypt's main administrative building in Tahrir Square
Dozens of anti-Muslim Brotherhood protesters have blocked the entrance to the Mogamma, the country's largest administrative building, in Cairo's Tahrir Square.
The protesters, who say they want to end the "Brotherhood's rule and push forward the goals of the revolution," erected barriers and barbed wire at the entrance to the building on Sunday morning, arousing anger among some members of the public trying to enter.
The building officially opens at 8am, but remains closed.
Meanwhile, dozens of tents are still pitched in the middle of Tahrir Square as part of a sit-in which began after President Morsi issued a controversial constitutional declaration in November granting himself near-absolute powers. The protesters' demands include holding early presidential elections, the dismissal of the current government, forming a new constitution-writing assembly, scraping the newly approved constitution, as well as dissolving the Shura Council (upper house of parliament).
