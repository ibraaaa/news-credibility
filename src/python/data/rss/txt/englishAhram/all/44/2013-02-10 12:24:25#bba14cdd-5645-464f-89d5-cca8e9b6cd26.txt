National Conscience Front launched 'to end violence'
New front made up of Islamists and some non-Islamists, including Ghad Al-Thawra Party head Ayman Nour, formed to 'end bloodshed' and achieve goals of revolution
The National Conscience Front includes former minister of state for parliamentary affairs Mohamed Mahsoub, Wasat Party deputy leader Essam Soltan, Freedom and Justice Party (FJP) figures Mohamed El-Beltagi and Helmy El-Gazzar, legal expert Ramadan Bateekh, Judges for Egypt leader Walid Shoraby, former presidential candidate Mohamed Selim El-Awa, Ghad Al-Thawra Party leader Ayman Nour, and MP Mohamed Mohieddin.
Launched at the El Sawy Culturewheel on Saturday, the front said it was not forming in opposition to the liberal National Salvation Front (NSF) headed by Mohamed ElBaradei, Hamdeen Sabbahi and Amr Moussa.
In addition, Hatem Azzam of the Civilization Party denied the initiative was connected with the national dialogue sponsored by Mohamed Morsi's government. It would act independently of the government and is open to anyone willing to participate, he added.
In a statement published on Friday, the front announced its goals were to put an end to the bloodshed currently taking place in the country, end violence, and help Egypt develop and achieve the goals of the January 25 Revolution.
The front is expected to form a coordinating committee in the coming days and announce an official spokesperson.
