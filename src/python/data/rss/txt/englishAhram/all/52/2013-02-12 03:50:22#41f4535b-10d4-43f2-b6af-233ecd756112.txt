Olympics: IOC recommends cutting wrestling from 2020 Games
Wrestling has been an Olympic sport since 1896, but may not feature in future games
Wrestling should be removed from the 2020 Olympic Games, the International Olympic Committee's Executive Board recommended on Tuesday as it looks to revamp the Games sports programme.
Wrestling, contested in the first modern Olympics in 1896, will join a list of seven other candidate sports battling for one spot on the programme. It is very unlikely, however, that wrestling will get back in.
The IOC session in Buenos Aires in September will still need to ratify the decision.
