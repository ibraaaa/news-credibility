Egypt's President Morsi to be interviewed Sunday
President Mohamed Morsi will be interviewed Sunday and plans to answer questions in 'full transparency and clarity' says Egypt's presidency statement
It is not clear, however, if the interview will be aired live.  
The interview will tackle "internal and external challenges Egypt faces" as well as "the presidency's economic, political and social vision," according to the statement.
The president will answer all frequently asked questions in full transparency and clarity, the statement adds.
President Morsi and the Cabinet led by the incumbent Hisham Qandil are both under fire mainly for increasing political tensions and economic woes.
The president also faces many criticisms for a widespread notion that Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood, the group he hails from, is the actual ruling body and not the presidency.
Morsi was inaugurated as Egypt's first civilian president last year after narrowly beating off competition from run-off contender Ahmed Shafiq. He has been in power for eight months.
