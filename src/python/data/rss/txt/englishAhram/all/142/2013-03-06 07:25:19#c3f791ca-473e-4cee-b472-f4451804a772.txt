Tens clash with police near US embassy in Cairo
Clashes with the police near Tahrir Square in Cairo continue for third day
Clashes re-erupted Wednesday between tens of protesters and police near the US embassy where security presence is most intense. Protesters, mostly young, blocked the Nile Corniche with a tree as they continued to throw rocks at the police.
It is unclear what triggered the restart of violence. However, intermittent clashes in the area have been ongoing for three days.
Since the January 25 Revolution second anniversary, violence has escalated in Cairo and other governorates after mass anti-government protests took to the streets. Port Said has seen a civil disobedience campaign in protest at perceived marginalisation by the government.
