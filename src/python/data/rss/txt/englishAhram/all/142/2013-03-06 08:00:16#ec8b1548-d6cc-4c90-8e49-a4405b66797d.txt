Zimbabwe's coach confident ahead of Egypt's World Cup qualifier match
Zimbabwe's coach expects positive results against Egypt in World Cup qualifier game scheduled for 26 March at Alexandria's Borg El-Arab stadium
 
Three weeks before Zimbabwe's upcoming clash against Egypt in World Cup qualifiers, the Warrior's coach Klaus-Dieter Pagels voiced confidence about his team ability to make a positive result against the Pharaohs.
The Egyptian national team will host their Zimbabwean counterpart on 26 March at Borg El-Arab stadium in Alexandria in day 3 of the World Cup qualifiers (Group G).
"I am confident my team will make a positive result in Egypt," Pagels told the Zimbabwean media on Wednesday.
The German coach was appointed as Zimbabwe's manager last November, following Rahman Gumbo's resignation after his failure to guide the country to reach the last edition of the Africa Cup of Nations.
Pagels admits his players' lack experience, but he confirmed that they will gain the knowledge soon.
"I know we have several players, who played two or three international matches in their career, but they are still playing. They have the chance to gain more experience."
"Our target is to not only make a positive result, but try to build a new team," he concluded.
Egypt's Pharaohs are leading in Group G with six points, five points ahead of third place Zimbabwe, who have only gained one point.
