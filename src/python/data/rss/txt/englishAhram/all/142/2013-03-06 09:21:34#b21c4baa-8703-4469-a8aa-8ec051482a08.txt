Manchester United's fan calls police to complain against Nani's red card
The young supporter was outraged over the referee's decision that helped Real Madrid oust Manchester United
An 18-year-old Manchester United fan became so incensed after a decision went against his team that he called the police during the match to report a crime.
On Wednesday, he apologized and was let off without punishment.
The unidentified fan called Nottinghamshire Police after United midfielder Nani was red-carded for dangerous play during Tuesday's 2-1 loss to Real Madrid in the Champions League.
Nottinghamshire Police chief inspector Ted Antill says "there may be people out there in real trouble who need our help and they have to wait because we are tied up with calls like this one, reporting a referee from the television."
Antill says the teenager could have been prosecuted for wasting police time and making a false report.
