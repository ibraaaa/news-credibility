FIFA bans Canada forward Occean for 6 matches
FIFA has ordered Canada forward Olivier Occean to serve a six-match ban after he was ejected and then insulted the referee during a World Cup qualifier against Cuba
Occean was sent off after a scuffle during Canada's 3-0 victory in Toronto on Oct. 12. FIFA says Occean committed an ''act of unsporting conduct'' then used ''offensive language'' toward the officials.
FIFA's disciplinary panel also fined the 31-year-old Eintracht Frankfurt player $9,250. He also must pay the costs of the proceedings.
Occean served the first of his six-match sanction when Canada lost 8-1 to Honduras and was eliminated from the 2014 World Cup. Occean must serve his ban at competitive matches, starting with the Gold Cup tournament in July.
