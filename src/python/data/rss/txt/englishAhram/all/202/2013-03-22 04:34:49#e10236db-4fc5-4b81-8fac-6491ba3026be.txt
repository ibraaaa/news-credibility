Sandstorm shuts 4 Egyptian seaports
Egyptian seaports and aviation have been negatively impacted by high-speed winds and low-visibility sand storm
Egypt’s Red Sea Ports Authority on Friday shut four ports due to high-speed winds and sandstorms that swept several provinces, especially in coastal areas.
The Egypt Meteorological Authority (EMA) says they prefer fishermen and motorists not engage in many outdoor activities under the low-visibility dusty skies, whose wind induces 3-metre high sea waves.
The EMA registered wind speed at 35 kilometres per hour and forecasts that the weather will better by sunset on Friday.
Temperature in Cairo on Friday records a moderate 26 Celsius (78 F) during the day, although it feels warmer due to the 35 percent humidity. By night it is expected to cool to 22 Celsius (71 F).
Over Egypt's coastal provinces and vital waterway, the Suez Canal, maximum temperatures range between 21 - 27 Celsius, however minimum temperatures forecast are 19 - 20 Celsius.
While moderate in the north, Egypt's southern provinces in Upper Egypt are experiencing a heat wave with daytime highs of 34 Celsius (93 F) in Luxor, expected to plunge to 22 Celsius by nightfall.
