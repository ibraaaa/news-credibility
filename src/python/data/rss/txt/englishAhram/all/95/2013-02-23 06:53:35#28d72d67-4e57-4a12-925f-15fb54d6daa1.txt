New York Fashion Week in 3 words
Three words can summarise the "look" of the New York 2013 fashion week displaying designer's vision for Autumn/Winter 2013: rich, serious and lines.
RICH
The colours down the New York Fashion Week runway lean towards very rich, saturated burgundies, burnt oranges, mustard yellows, that offset the subtle tans, sophisticated blacks and greys. The burgundies were loaned in from last year, where they also made a big presence in New York shows.
SERIOUS
Serious? Not only are the colours serious, but the fabrics chosen. Like their British counterparts, tweed, cottons and satiny materials dominated, with very little in between it seems. Every once in a while, as is the recent global trend, a designer will throw in a bright, almost cheerful colour or lighten up a rather serious outfit with one piece with a scribble or whimsical artistic spatter.
LINES
The chicken or the egg: Is it that designers who prefer the New York fashion week compete with each other on the most creative, skillfull use of line, or is it their sophisticated audience who can perceive talent in the way that the designer constructs the line and therefore inspires the designer to feed their appetite for it? Regardless, how a designer can construct lines in a sort of modern, wearable art is quite characteristic on the New york catwalks.
