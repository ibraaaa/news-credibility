Protesters block entrance to Cairo's Mogamma for third day
Protesters opposed to Muslim Brotherhood continue sit-in at Egypt's largest administrative building in Tahrir Square for a third day
Anti-Muslim Brotherhood protesters continue to block the entrances to the Mogamma administrative building in Cairo's Tahrir Square for a third day on Tuesday.
Protesters gathered at building on Sunday and blocked the entrances with barriers and barbed wire to condemn Egypt's Islamist-led government and "push forward with the goals of the revolution."
Some members of the public, angry at not being able to access services at the building, called on protesters to end their sit-in, but the latter refused.
Meanwhile, calm descended on Tahrir Square on Tuesday morning following a night of small-scale protests to mark the second anniversary of the day Hosni Mubarak was forced to resign from power.
The vicinity of the presidential palace in Cairo's Heliopolis district also saw an uneasy calm after clashes erupted late on Monday.
Dozens of protesters were injured as security forces used birdshot pellets, teargas canisters and water hoses to disperse the crowds. Several cases of arrests by plain-clothes officers were also reported.
Clashes intensified after midnight when an armoured Central Security Forces (CSF) vehicle reportedly drove towards protesters. Shortly afterwards, angry protesters set the vehicle alight. CSF vehicles later pushed the battle back to the end of the Merghani Street, where the palace is located.
On Monday, hundreds of protesters in Cairo and other governorates took to the streets to mark the second anniversary of former president Hosni Mubarak's ouster.
In Cairo, anti-Brotherhood protesters marched from different meeting points towards Tahrir Square and the presidential palace to demand a unity government and constitutional amendments.
