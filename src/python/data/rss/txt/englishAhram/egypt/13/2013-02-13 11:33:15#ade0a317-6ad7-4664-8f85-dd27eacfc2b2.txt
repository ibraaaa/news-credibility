Egyptian Nasserist defends controversial visit to Syria’s Al-Assad
Co-founder of Egyptian Nasserist Party, Farouq El-Eshri, defends meeting with Bashar Al-Assad, who he describes as 'the last line of defence for Pan-Arabism'
An Egyptian Nasserist Party (ENP) delegation has stirred controversy by visiting Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad.
“Our visit to Syria in support of Bashar Al-Assad came out of our genuine intention to back the resistance against American and Zionist plans in the region,” Farouq El-Eshri, co-founder of the ENP told Al-Ahram Arabic website.
The delegation had no intention of meeting with the Syrian opposition at the moment, he added.
Around 60,000 people have been killed during an ongoing two-year uprising against the Al-Assad government.
The meeting with Al-Assad on Tuesday did not find any solutions to the Syrian crisis, El-Eshri added, because no one can end it now.
“If Bashar falls, we are left with three scenarios: 1. the fall of ‘Arab Nationalist’ Syria, 2. Syria will fall under the rule of the Muslim Brotherhood, 3. It will be a civil war.”
Syria is the last defence line for Pan-Arabism, El-Eshri added.
Bashar Al-Assad is also the leader of the Arab Socialist Ba’ath Party in Syria.
