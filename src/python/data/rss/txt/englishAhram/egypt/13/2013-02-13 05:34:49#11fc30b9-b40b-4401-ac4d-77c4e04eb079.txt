Egyptian 'death threats' sheikh released on bail
Mahmoud Shaaban, the Al-Azhar professor who issued a fatwa sanctioning the killing of opposition politicians, is released on bail after being questioned by the prosecution
An Al-Azhar professor, who issued a fatwa sanctioning the killing of opposition politicians, has been released on LE5,000 bail.
Mahmoud Shaaban was arrested on Monday and brought before the prosecution on Wednesday.
Members of Salafist groups Al-Gamaa Al-Islamiya and Hazemoon gathered in support of Shaaban in front of the High Court while he was being questioned.
Maged Mohamed of the Journalists' Syndicate said there was no need to arrest Shaaban; it would have been enough to request his attendance for questioning.  
Shaaban issued the religious fatwa last week during his show on an Islamic satellite channel. It gave religious sanction to the killing of National Salvation Front (NSF) leaders Mohamed ElBaradei and Hamdeen Sabbahi.
Lawyer Khaled Taher filed a complaint against Shabaan for incitement to murder.
The fatwa was condemned by politicians from across the political spectrum, including Prime Minister Hisham Qandil.
