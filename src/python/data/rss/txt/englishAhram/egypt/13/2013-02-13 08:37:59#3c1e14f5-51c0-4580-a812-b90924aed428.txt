Egypt's Cabinet provisionally approves anti-torture law
The government is determined to combat torture, assures presidential aide Ahmed Mekki, announcing the approval of an anti-torture law
The Egyptian government has provisionally approved Wednesday criminal codes under the "combating torture" law, announced the Minister of Justice Ahmed Mekki.
At a press conference, Mekki said he was proud to see such a law emerge, urging the media to raise awareness on its contents.
Mekki said the law would protect Egypt's ruler, as the existence of torture was one of the main indicators of the failure of the former regime.
The law has been drafted after new cases of alleged police torture surfaced in Egypt. Activist Mohamed El-Gendy is believed to have been arrested during an anti-government demonstration in the wake of the second anniversary of the January 25 Revolution and to have died due to police torture during his detention.
