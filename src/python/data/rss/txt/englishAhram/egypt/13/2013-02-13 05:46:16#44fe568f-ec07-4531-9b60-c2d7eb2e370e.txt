A friend of the slain activist, who wished to remain anonymous, told Ahram Online that Mehrez had previously been a member of the Muslim Brotherhood but had left the group and become an independent Islamist activist.
"Mehrez wanted to travel to Syria for a long time to fight among the rebel fighters against Al-Assad's regime; he was saving money and had sports training in order to be fit for fighting there," said a friend of the slain activist, who spoke to Ahram Online on condition of anonymity.
The friend added that Mehrez went to Syria alone and not as part of a group.

Mehrez is the latest Egyptian to be killed in combat in Syria while fighting with the Free Syrian Army against the Syrian regime. Over the past two years, no fewer than 10 Egyptians were killed while fighting in Syria with rebel groups. According to observers, most of those killed are Islamists.
