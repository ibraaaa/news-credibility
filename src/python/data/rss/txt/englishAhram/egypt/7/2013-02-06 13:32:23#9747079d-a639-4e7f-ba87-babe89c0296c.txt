Egypt guards kill migrant trying to enter Israel
An Egyptian security official says border guards have shot and killed a Sudanese man who was trying to illegally cross into Israel.
The official said Wednesday the guards fired in the air, but the Sudanese man ignored the warnings and was shot dead. The body of 19-year-old Mukhtar al-Hafed al-Bashir was taken to the hospital in Rafah near the border.
The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to brief reporters.
Egyptian border guards frequently open fire on African migrants trying to sneak into Israel, drawing criticism from human rights groups.
Thousands of Africans try to reach Israel from Egypt every year, risking a dangerous desert crossing, seeking work or asylum.
