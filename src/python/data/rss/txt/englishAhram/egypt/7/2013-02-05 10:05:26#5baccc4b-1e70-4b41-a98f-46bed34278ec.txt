Head of Egypt's Journalists Syndicate to step down at next elections
Beleaguered head of the Journalists Syndicate announces he will not run in the board elections in March
Head of Journalists Syndicate Mamdouh El-Wali and Chief executive officer of state-run newspaper Al-Ahram announced Tuesday that he will not run in the upcoming round of board elections "to make room for new blood."
El-Wali, who assumed leadership of the syndicate in October 2011, caused a storm of controversy among syndicate members in late November when, as a member of the Constituent Assembly, he voted on the draft constitution, despite the syndicate board's decision to withdraw all board members from the assembly on the grounds that the draft did not uphold press freedoms.
The Islamist-affiliated journalist has also been accused by critics of serving the political interests of the Muslim Brotherhood at the expense of journalists' demands, as well as ignoring their financial grievances regarding bonuses and pensions.
El-Wali, however, said he vows to resolve some of these grievances before he leaves his position.
The new round of board elections will be held on 1 March.
