Autopsy reports on slain Egypt activists to be sent to prosecution next week
Egyptian forensic authorities tell Al-Ahram that Amr Saad was killed by automatic weapon fire while Mohamed El-Gendy died of head trauma, internal bleeding
Official autopsy reports on slain activists Amr Saad and Mohamed El-Gendy will be referred to the prosecutor-general's office next week, Egypt's top coroner Ehsan Kamil Georgy announced Tuesday.
However, in Tuesday statements to Al-Ahram's Arabic-language news website, forensic authorities revealed the causes of the two men's deaths.
According to Emad El-Dib, deputy head of the chief coroner's office, an autopsy of Saad's body has revealed that the activist was shot in both the chest and stomach by an automatic weapon. El-Dib added that the victim had been shot at close range.
As for slain activist El-Gendy, El-Dib told Al-Ahram that forensic authorities had found that the young man had suffered head trauma that led to internal bleeding in the brain that ultimately caused his death.
The two slain men were both members of the opposition Egyptian Popular Current.
El-Gendy died on Monday after having been allegedly tortured by police following his arrest during 27 January clashes near Cairo's Tahrir Square.
Saad also died on Monday, succumbing to injuries sustained during Friday's clashes between protesters and security forces outside the Presidential Palace in Cairo.
According to a report issued Sunday by several Egyptian rights activists, a total of 225 people have been detained by police from the vicinity of Tahrir Square since the second anniversary of Egypt's January 25 Revolution.
This year's anniversary coincided with mass rallies against the government and Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi.
