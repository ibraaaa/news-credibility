Tahrir Square re-opens to traffic
Following late night skirmishes near Garden City, security forces disperse Tahrir Square sit-in, make arrests; normal traffic flow returns to the square
Security forces re-opened Tahrir Square early on Sunday morning, removing tents and evicting peaceful protesters. 
Barbed wire across the entrances to the square from Qasr El-Nil Bridge and Abdel-Moneim Riyad Square was removed, allowing traffic to flow normally.
The move to re-open the square came after skirmishes late on Saturday between security forces and unknown assailants who had blocked the corniche in front of the Semiramis Hotel in Garden City. Molotov cocktails were thrown at the security forces.
Security forces arrested a number of those allegedly responsible for the violence on the corniche as they tried to escape through Tahrir Square. The exact number of those arrested remains unconfirmed.
Protesters have been holding a sit-in in Tahrir Square intermittently since 22 November when President Morsi issued a controversial constitutional declaration that rendered his decisions above judicial supervision.
Most recently, however, the square was occupied by protesters following the second anniversary of the January 25 Revolution and the ensuing violence. On 26 February, police arrested 65 people while removing metal barriers and barbed wire from the streets leading to Tahrir Square.
A small number of tents and protesters remain in the centre of the square.
