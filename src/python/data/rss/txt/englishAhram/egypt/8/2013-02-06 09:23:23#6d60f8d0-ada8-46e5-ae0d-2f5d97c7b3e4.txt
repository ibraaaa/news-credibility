Salvation Front youth call for mass rallies, Friday of 'toppling the regime'
Demonstrations against President Mohamed Morsi and his government planned for Friday after a bloody month in which tens of protesters were killed
National Salvation Front (NSF) youth members together with other political coalitions called Wednesday for fresh rallies Friday under the banner "Toppling the regime."
At a press conference held at the Wafd Party headquarters, youth members of the front called for mass demonstrations to take place in Egypt's squares.
The groups also announced they will form a legal committee to trace the killers of the revolution's youth. The committee is also to follow up on all cases related to the January 25 Revolution including those related to the detained, missing and tortured during the presidential palace demonstrations.
Last Friday's demonstrations at the presidential palace turned violent after demonstrators threw Molotov cocktails at the presidential headquarters and police responded firing tear gas and rubber bullets.
Many were detained during Friday's violent events. Two died during the clashes including Amr Saad, a member of the Popular current who succumbed to injuries from a live bullet.
On Monday, another member of the Popular Current, Mohamed El-Gendy, died from torture allegedly inflicted in police detention last week.
Other political groups present at the press conference included the Kefaya movement, the Maspero Youth Coalition and the National Association for Change.
Several political groups from Alexandria and Suez have also called for mass marches to take place Friday, including the Suez Revolutionary Bloc and the Alexandria Youth Coalition.
