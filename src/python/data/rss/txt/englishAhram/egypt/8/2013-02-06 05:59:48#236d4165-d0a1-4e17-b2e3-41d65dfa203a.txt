Egyptian women protest sexual harassment on Wednesday
Demonstrators set to take to Cairo streets to denounce assaults, rape and a string of recent attacks on women protesters
Egyptian women's rights groups and activists are organising a march on Wednesday at 4pm to highlight the issue of sexual harassment and assault in Egypt.
Sexual assaults on women in Tahrir Square have been common during large protests and demonstrations, with around 25 being reported on 25 January, the second anniversary of the revolution.
Yasmin El-Bormay, an activist who was sexually assaulted by a gang in Mohamed Mahmoud Street off Tahrir Square, recounted her experiences on private television channel Al-Nahar, saying that a large group of men, some armed with knives, tore off her clothes and sexually assaulted her.
The march will proceed from Sayyeda Zeinab Mosque to Tahrir Square.
