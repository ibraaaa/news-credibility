Teenager cancer patient released after 9 days in detention in Alexandria
Fourteen-year-old cancer sufferer Mahmoud Adel, who was arrested during clashes in Alexandria nine days ago, has been released from detention
A teenage cancer sufferer, who was arrested during clashes in Alexandria, has been released after spending nine days in detention.
Mahmoud Adel, 14, who has bone cancer, was released from custody on Wednesday after being arrested by security forces on 27 January.
A judge had earlier refused to grant his release and ordered him to be detained for 15 days.
Adel was boarding a bus when he was arrested, his mother told Ahram Online.
The Mediterranean city witnessed intermittent anti-police and anti-government clashes between 20 and 28 January. Dozens were arrested, including minors.
Human rights groups say security forces engaged in a "campaign of random arrests and kidnapping … in response to protests."
