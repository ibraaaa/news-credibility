Egypt's Morsi cancels trip to Paris
Morsi's trip to France cancelled hours after spokesman confirmation that it would go ahead
Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi cancelled his trip to France scheduled for Thursday and will shorten his visit to Germany planned for Wednesday, according to Al-Ahram's Arabic website. 
Accompanying Morsi will be the ministers of foreign affairs, industry, planning and international cooperation.
A few hours prior to the notification of the trip's cancellation, presidential spokesman Yasser Ali stated during a press conference that Morsi's trip to Germany and France would not be cancelled.
On Friday, the second anniversary of the January 25 revolution, the presidency had also announced that Morsi would not cancel his visit to Addis Ababa to attend an African Union summit; however, as violent clashes continued in the country, he chose to send the minister of foreign affairs on his behalf.
Clashes and riots continued on Tuesday for a fifth day, with a 30-day state of emergency and curfew imposed on the three Suez Canal cities of Port Said, Suez and Ismailia where violence was most severe. More than 50 civilians have been killed during the nationwide clashes, of which 39 were from Port Said.
