Suez Canal governors can 'amend curfew', says President Morsi
Egypt's President Morsi grants governors of Port Said, Ismailia and Suez authority to amend curfew imposed after days of violent protests
President Morsi has granted the governors of Port Said, Ismailia and Suez the authority to amend or cancel a recently imposed curfew.
The move comes in response to the first national dialogue session, official presidential sources told the Turkish Anadolu news agency.
On Sunday, President Morsi declared a 30-day state of emergence and a daily 9pm to 6am curfew in the cities which were witnessing widespread protests.
On Saturday, violence erupted in Port Said after 21 local people were sentenced to death for their role in a deadly football riot in February 2012.
Violent protests erupted in Suez and Ismailia on Friday's second anniversary of the January 25 Revolution.
Morsi has been criticised by his opponents for what they say is his poor reaction to clashes that left at least 39 civilians and two police officers dead in Port Said. In Suez, nine people died, including one police conscript. At least one civilian was reported killed in Ismailia.
Protests against the curfew and state of emergency continued in the three cities on Tuesday.
