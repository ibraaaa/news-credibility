Legal board supports suspension of Egypt's parliamentary elections
Judicial body the office of state commissioners called for rejection of presidency's lawsuit against a court ruling that halted upcoming elections
Egypt’s office of state commissioners, a judicial body responsible for issuing non-binding recommendations on cases to the courts, called for the rejection of the appeal filed by the presidency and the Shura Council against the decision to halt the parliamentary elections.
On 6 March, Egypt’s Supreme Administrative Court overturned a presidential decree that called for parliamentary elections to begin on 22 April.
The presidential decree was suspended as questions arose over the constitutionality of the electoral law, after the High Constitutional Court rejected five of its articles on 18 February.
The law was referred back to the Shura Council, Egypt's upper house of parliament which holds temporary legislative power, for amendments, and the council partially amended the legislation without referring it back to the HCC.
President Mohamed Morsi then issued a decree declaring that parliamentary polls would be held in late April.
The court ruling stated that the Shura Council should have referred the law back to the HCC before ratifying it, so as to ensure the constitutionality of the amendments.
Egypt’s Supreme Administrative Court is expected to deliver a ruling on the suspension of parliamentary elections on Sunday.
One appeal against the suspension was filed by the Egyptian State Lawsuit Authority on behalf of the presidency, and another was submitted by former MP Mohamed El-Omda.
