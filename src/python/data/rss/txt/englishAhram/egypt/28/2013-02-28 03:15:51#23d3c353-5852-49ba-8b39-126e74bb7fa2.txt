Military will defend Egypt against internal or external threats: El-Sisi
Defence minister General Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi addresses new class of students completing basic military training
Egypt's Minister of Defence General Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi stated on Thursday that the Egyptian military will "uphold its pledge to God, the nation, and its people in protecting the nation's security," and will always remain capable of fulfilling the aspirations of its people.
Speaking at ceremony marking the graduation of students at the military academy and the technical institutes of the armed forces from basic military training, El-Sisi asserted that the students are joining a path towards becoming the "protectors of the homeland."
He directed a message of appreciation to the students' parents, saying: "I salute you on what you have given to the nation, [those] who will defend it against any hostilities it is to face internally or externally."
El-Sisi announced that this class of students will be named the Saad El-Shazli class, in honour of former president Anwar El-Sadat's chief of staff and a celebrated war hero who founded the Egyptian paratrooper battalion in 1954.
Shazli was forced into exile after criticising the Camp David agreement in 1978.
