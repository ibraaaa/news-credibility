Egypt army soldiers get new uniforms to combat impersonation
Hamas calls for investigation after Egypt discovers fabric used to make army uniforms in Gaza tunnel
On Sunday, General Osama Askar, head of Egypt's Third Army, called on local people to remain alert to 'fake' soldiers.
An army spokesman said fabric used in Egyptian army uniforms had been found in a newly discovered tunnel on the Egypt-Gaza border. He called on people to  “show vigilance in the days ahead and be aware of any incident involving the impersonation of military personnel.”
Hamas, which governs the Gaza Strip, called for an investigation into the smuggled fabric and said Palestinians would never jeopardise Egypt’s security.
The fabric was probably intended for children's uniforms or Gazan resistance groups because military fabric cannot be imported from Israel, Hamas spokesman Taher El-Nono told Egyptian satellite TV station Al-Mehwer.
“However I can’t give a clear answer until the investigation is complete,” he added.
El-Nono rejected any suggestion Hamas intended to attack the Egyptian army and said “the hand that considers doing harm to Egypt will be cut.”
Recent media reports have claimed Palestinians from Gaza were behind the killing of 16 Egyptian soldiers in Rafah near the Egypt-Gaza border in August 2012.
Hamas has vehemently 
denied
 the allegations.
Hamas Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh said on Saturday that Palestinians would never forget the "sacrifices" made by Egypt for the Palestinian cause.
