383 Egyptian children detained in last 2 months: Rights group
Egyptian children's rights group says that the number of minors arrested in recent clashes is unprecedented
"The interior ministry has detained 383 children since the second anniversary of the January 25 revolution, an unprecedented number in Egypt's history," read a Sunday press statement by the Egyptian Coalition on Children's Rights.
The statement condemned the interior ministry's arrests of the children, and held the government accountable for their detention.
According to the statement, 157 children were detained between 24 January and 16 February of this year, 29 of whom were less than 15 years old, and 12 of whom are still in detention.
Another 226 children were arrested during the clashes between 26 February and 16 March 2013, according to the statement. This included the arrest of 62 minors; of those, 99 are still detained, the statement said.
Examples of recent interventions by the coalition to assist detained minors including the case of Islam Hassan, 16, in Cairo. Coalition lawyers launched legal procedures against security personnel who allegedly caused facial injuries during his arrest.
In another incident, coalition lawyers assisted Jana Abdel Fatah, 3, who was detained for a month with her mother after Tahrir clashes.
Many rights activists have warned of increasing numbers of children arrested and detained in 2013, and increasing numbers of rights violations against minors.
Earlier in February, Abdel Rahman, 13, was detained for two weeks with 14-year-old bone cancer patient Mahmoud Adel, whose story hit international headlines after the judge initially refused to allow him chemotherapy.
Both boys, who say they were bystanders to the Alexandrian demonstration, were only released after significant pressure from rights groups like the Egyptian Organisation for Human Rights.
