Egypt's parliamentary affairs minister resigns for medical reasons
Egypt's new minister for legal and parliamentary affairs is expected to be announced in coming days, says official source in cabinet council
Omar Salem, minister for parliamentary issues, has resigned for medical reasons, according to an official source in the cabinet council.
Egyptian Prime Minister Hisham Qandil accepted Salem's resignation and has been reviewing a number of nominees for the position, the official source told Al-Ahram's Arabic-language news website.
The new minister is expected to be announced in a few days, the source further explained.
Salem's resignation on Sunday marks another change in the ministerial role. He was a criminal law professor at Cairo University and occupied the same position under the interim premiership of Kamal El-Ganzouri, which preceded the current government of Prime Minister Hisham Qandil.
Mohamed Mahsoub, former minister of legal and parliamentary affairs, resigned in December 2012 to protest against President Morsi's policies.
Mahsoub citied that many of the policies adopted by the government "contradict" his personal beliefs and "do not reflect the aspirations of the people after the [January 25] revolution or the sacrifices they made for it to succeed."
