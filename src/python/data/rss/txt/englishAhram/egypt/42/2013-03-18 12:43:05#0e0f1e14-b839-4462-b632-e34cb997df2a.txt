Microbus strike brings Mahalla to standstill
Striking microbus drivers block major roads and railways in Nile Delta's Mahalla in ongoing protest over fuel shortages
Microbus drivers in Mahalla are on strike for the second day over fuel shortages, state news agency MENA reported on Monday.
Strike action is taking place at almost all bus stations in the Nile Delta city and major thoroughfares have been blocked by protesting drivers.
Railway tracks in the city have also been blocked by protesters since Monday morning, MENA reported.
The striking drivers are angry at fuel shortages and the high price of diesel on the black market due to lax government controls and the failure of police to monitor petrol stations.
Meanwhile, there are long queues at petrol stations in the Nile Delta governorate of Qalioubiya.
Scuffles broke out on Monday between drivers frustrated at long waiting times at petrol stations, Al-Ahram Arabic news website reported.
Cairo and Giza
Microbus drivers in Cairo and Giza went on strike for several days last week to protest ongoing fuel shortages.
Egypt has suffered from fuel shortages since the January 25 Revolution.
Fuel subsidies make up approximately half of the total subsidies in the state budget, which in turn amounts to 25 percent of total state spending.
