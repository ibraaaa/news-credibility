Cairo protests against summons of opposition activists
Opposition to protest in front of High Court in Cairo on Tuesday after prosecutor-general summons activists for their alleged incitement of clashes at Muslim Brotherhood HQ on Friday
Police have stepped up their presence outside the court in preparation for the expected demonstrations.
On Monday evening, the office of Prosecutor-General Talaat Abdullah summoned renowned blogger Alaa Abdel-Fattah, Popular Current member Ahmed Doma, National Salvation Front member Hazem Abdel-Azim, Constitution Party member Ahmed Eid, activist Karim El-Shaer, and journalist and blogger Nawara Negm for questioning.
Alaa Abdel-Fattah has said he will respond to the summons in order to protect his family from further police harassment. But the other summoned activists have said their will not respond.
 
The summons were made after Brotherhood lawyer Abdel-Moneim Abdel-Maksoud filed a complaint with the prosecutor-general against 169 individuals – including party heads, politicians and "thugs" – whom he accused of inciting the violence on Friday.
Among the political figures summoned for questioning were Egyptian Social Democratic Party leader Mohamed Abul-Ghar, Free Egyptians Party member Mahmoud El-Alaily and former Revolution Youth Coalition member Khaled Telima.
The liberal Constitution Party and No to Military Trials group called for Tuesday's protest.
Police have so far failed to arrest three Brotherhood workers accused of attacking anti-Brotherhood protesters on Friday.
Nationwide clashes between supporters and opponents of the Muslim Brotherhood on Friday left at least 200 people injured.
The protests on Friday took place in response to earlier attacks on anti-Brotherhood protesters by Brotherhood members outside the Islamist group's headquarters.
