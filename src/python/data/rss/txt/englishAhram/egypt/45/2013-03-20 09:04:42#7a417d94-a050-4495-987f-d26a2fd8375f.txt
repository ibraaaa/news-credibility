Prosecutors extend detention of Salafist Saber on suspicion of murder links
Gamal Saber, a former supporter of Hazem Salah Abu-Ismail, is detained for four days pending investigation after son is accused of killing 15-year-old boy
The move came in the wake of accusations that his son had killed a 15-year-old boy.
Violence erupted in Cairo's working-class Shubra district on Monday after Saad Dorra, 15, was killed during a football match at a local high school, allegedly at the hands of Saber's son.  
During questioning by police, Saber denied that either of his sons – Ahmed or Abdel-Rahman – had been involved in the young man's death.
He also denied his own involvement in the subsequent violence on Monday, saying he had only heard about the clashes from neighbours.
Three people were killed and 26 injured in the Shubra clashes, in which relatives of the slain boy fought with relatives and associates of Saber with shotguns loaded with birdshot and Molotov cocktails, state news agency MENA reported.
On Tuesday, police arrested Saber's son. Attempts to arrest others suspected of having links to the violence remain ongoing.
