Egypt's court acquits 34 accused in Nile Corniche violence
Thirty-four acquitted, one sentenced to two months in prison, over March clashes on Cairo's Nile Corniche
Qasr El-Nil Misdemeanour Court acquitted 34 defendants who were recently arrested during on-and-off clashes in front of the InterContinental Semiramis Hotel on the Nile Corniche near downtown Cairo.
However, the court sentenced Mostafa Mamdouh to two months in prison and LE200 bail.
The acquitted were accused of assaulting security forces, attempting to raid both Semiramis and Shepherd Hotel, possession of cocktail molotovs, blocking the road and subjecting citizens to danger.
They stressed all along that they were arrested by the police randomly while they were simply passing through the neighbourhood where the clashes erupted.
Intermittent clashes have been taking place in several places in Cairo and across Egypt since the January 25 Revolution second anniversary.
