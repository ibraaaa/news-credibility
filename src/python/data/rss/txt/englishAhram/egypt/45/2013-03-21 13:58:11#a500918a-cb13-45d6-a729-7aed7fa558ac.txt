Journalists' Syndicate rejects Brotherhood 'apology'
Egyptian Journalists' Syndicate says it does not accept Brotherhood 'apology' for recent 'attacks' on journalists, urges prosecutor-general to complete investigation into events at Brotherhood HQ
The Journalists' Syndicate has rejected an 'apology' by the Muslim Brotherhood regarding the group's reported attacks on journalists at its HQ in Cairo's Moqattam.
The Brotherhood published a statement on its official Facebook page saying it "respects journalists."
"The Brotherhood's apology was not enough because it did not say how those responsible for the attacks would be held accountable," syndicate member Khaled El-Meery explained during a telephone call on ONTV satellite channel on Thursday.
On Saturday, Brotherhood members and guards clashed with anti-Brotherhood activists and graffiti artists outside the group’s headquarters. A number of journalists and photographers were beaten during the clashes.
Clashes resumed on Sunday when police dispersed several hundred protesters who had gathered at the HQ to protest the "assaults" committed by Brotherhood members the day before.
During a meeting of the syndicate's council that concluded early on Thursday, it was decided that an urgent message would be sent to the prosecutor-general urging him to complete his investigation into the events.
The message agreed upon during the meeting also criticised the Brotherhood for filming a photographer while he was being attacked outside the Brotherhood HQ and for claiming that the photographer had provoked the attack.
Activists and opposition groups have called for a demonstration on Friday at the Brotherhood's headquarters in Cairo to protest what they describe as attacks by Brotherhood members and security forces on opposition activists.
