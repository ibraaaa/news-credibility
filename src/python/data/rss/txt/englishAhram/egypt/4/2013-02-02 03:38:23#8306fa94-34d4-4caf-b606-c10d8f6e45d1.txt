Ex-interior minister sentenced for abusing position to build luxury villa
Mubarak-era minister of interior Habib El-Adly and his aide get jail time for abusing conscripts in domestic work for his villa
The Cairo criminal court sentenced former minister of interior Habib El-Adly and his former assistant Hassan Abdel-Hameed to three years in jail for using ministry conscripts to do plumbing work and paint the walls of El-Adly's private villa.
In the case that began in July, the court also fined El-Adly and Abdel-Hameed LE 2,300,000 (roughly $340,000).
In one of the trial's previous sessions, eyewitnesses accused the defendants of utilising at least 44 vehicles to construct a pool and fence for the villa. The expenses for using the vehicles were estimated at more than LE2 million (roughly $300,000).
El-Adly was already serving a life sentence along with ousted president Hosni Mubarak for their responsibility in the killing of peaceful protesters during the January 25 uprising. The court has accepted an appeal for the re-trial of the defendants.
The ex-minister, whose era is infamous for the rise of police brutality, was also sentenced to seven years on charges of illegal profiteering and five years for money laundering.
