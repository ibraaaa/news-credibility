Egypt's Nour Party backs opposition demands for new prosecutor-general
Head of Egypt's leading Salafist party joins opposition National Salvation Front in calling for dismissal of Morsi-appointed prosecutor-general
The current government of Egyptian Prime Minister Hisham Qandil has "completely failed" to manage the nation's affairs, Salafist Nour Party Chairman Younes Makhioun stated on Friday.
"Egypt is still plagued with numerous crises, especially pertaining to fuel shortfalls and railway disasters," Makhioun said at a meeting in the Nile Delta governorate of Kafr El-Sheikh with party members and members of the affiliated Salafist Calling movement.
Makhioun added that the Nour Party had backed demands by the National Salvation Front (NSF) umbrella opposition group for the immediate dismissal of Egypt's recently-appointed prosecutor-general due to "the method of his appointment."
Prosecutor-General Talaat Abdallah was appointed late last year by President Mohamed Morsi over the objections of much of Egypt's judiciary, which saw the move as a breach of judicial independence.
Makhioun went on to say that Egypt's Supreme Judicial Council should move quickly to nominate a new prosecutor-general.
