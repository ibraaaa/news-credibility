The National Salvation Front, Egypt's main opposition bloc, will hold a number of public conferences on Friday at 6pm in Suez, Port Said on the Suez Canal and Mahalla in El-Gharbiya governorate, to "connect with the public."
Among the speakers in NSF public conferences are Amr Hamzawy, Egyptian politician and activist; George Ishaaq, veteran political activist and founder of the Kefaya movement;  Khaled Dawood, the NSF's official spokesman; Sameh Ashour, the head of the Egyptian Lawyers Syndicate; and Gamila Ismail, the TV anchor and liberal Ghad Party founder.
The NSF and the Salafist Nour Party had agreed on Thursday on the necessity of the resignation of Hisham Qandil's cabinet and the appointment of a new prosecutor-general through the Supreme Judicial Council in order to end the current political impasse in the country, said the official spokesman of the NSF.
In a telephone call to
Al-Hayah Al-Youm
programme on the satellite Hayat TV channel on Thursday, Dawood said that both groups agreed on the importance of forming a national salvation government.
Dawood said that the NSF is ready for a national dialogue and "is awaiting the president's reply to the opposition's demand for a new government."
