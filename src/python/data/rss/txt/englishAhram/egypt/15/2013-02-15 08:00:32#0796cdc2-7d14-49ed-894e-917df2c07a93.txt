Hundreds of Ultras protesters demand trial of former SCAF leaders
Ultras Ahlawy march on ministry of defence in Cairo to demand prosecution of Field Marshal Tantawi and General Anan for 'crimes against protesters' during the rule of the military council
The protesters (who organised their demonstration uner the banner: "First step in retribution - The Generals) are demanding the trial of former members of Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF) for "the crimes they committed against protesters" during the period the SCAF ruled the country between February 2011 and June 2012.
The Ultras have focused on three key SCAF leaders in their quest for prosecution: the head of SCAF Field Marshal Mohamed Hussein Tantawy, the second-in-command General Sami Anan and Hamdy Badeen, the former commander of military police.
The Ultras chanted "The people want the execution of Tantawi" and lit the skies with their hallmark fireworks.
The Ultras also took on President Mohamed Morsi for retiring both Tantawi and Anan last August without conducting investigations into crimes they allegedly ordered against protesters, then honouring them with high state medals.
Ultras are also angry that President Morsi sent Hamdy Badeen to serve as military attache at the Egyptian embassy in China "instead of holding him accountable for attacks on protesters."
Meanwhile, hundreds of protesters who were attending a funeral for Sweet Potato seller Omar Salah "13 years old", who was shot by an army soldieron 3 February 2013 near the US embassy, have joined the Ultras protest at the ministry of defence.
Tens of protesters against military rule were killed during the rule of the SCAF and hundreds were injured.
