Both groups agreed on the importance of formulating a national salvation government and await President Morsi's response
Khaled Dawood, official spokesman of the National Salvation Front, Egypt's main opposition bloc, said in a telephone call to TV programme
Al-Hayah Al-Youm
 
on Hayah channel that both groups agreed on the importance of formulating a national salvation government.
Dawood also said that the NSF is ready for a national dialogue and is awaiting the president's "intention in formulating a new government."
He said that both parties agreed on the importance of stopping violence and working on maintaining the peacefulness of protests.
The NSF and the Nour Party agree on formulating a cabinet of candidates who have the expertise and competency to manage the electoral process with full integrity and neutrality, he said.
Dawood further explained that the NSF is ready to conduct a meeting on Sunday or Monday to explore national dialogue, after consensus was reached between the NSF and the Nour party.
Both parties are hoping to include other political forces in the consensus.
He also added that the Al-Azhar document, which was endorsed by the NSF on 31 January, will be the basis of the agenda on which they will build national dialogue.
The document was proposed to end Egypt's ongoing clashes and political violence.
Earlier, on 30 January, the NSF and the Nour Party agreed on a unified initiative that aimed to end Egypt's ongoing political crisis.
The initiative includes eight terms. The main feature is the formation of a unity government that includes the representation of opposition groups.
The Nour Party is Egypt's second largest Islamist group after the Muslim Brotherhood and the latter's Freedom and Justice Party.
