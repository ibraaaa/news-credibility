Calls for govt replacement untimely: Al-Gamaa Al-Islamiya senior member
Al-Gamaa Al-Islamiya leading member Safwat Abdul-Ghani claims calls for replacing Egypt's current cabinet are 'premature' and recommends waiting for court verdict on electoral legislation fate
Speaking at the group’s headquarters in Cairo's Mohandeseen district on Thursday, Abdul-Ghani, who is also the head of the group's parliamentary bloc in Egypt's Shura Council (upper house of parliament), asserted that his group would only call for a replacement of the current government – a major demand by Egypt's opposition – when it is "necessary."
Abdul-Ghani advised to wait until the fate of the new parliamentary elections law is decided first.
Last week, Egyp's Administrive Court suspended parliamentary elections after refereeing Egyptian electoral legislation to the High Constitutional Court (HCC) to decide on its "constitutionality."
On Tuesday, cabinet spokesman Alaa El-Hadidi stated that the dismissal – or even reshuffle – of the Qandil government was "not on the table," asserting that President Mohamed Morsi was a "major supporter" of the current cabinet.
For its part, Egypt's largest opposition umbrella group, the National Salvation Front (NSF), has vowed to boycott upcoming parliamentary polls – along with all talks with the presidency – until President Morsi meets a raft of preconditions. These include the replacement of the government, the dismissal of the Morsi-appointed prosecutor-general, and the launch of credible investigations into recent political violence.
Demands for the dismissal of the current government have been supported by the Salafist Nour Party, Egypt's second largest Islamist party after the Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party (FJP).
The Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party, meanwhile, from which President Morsi hails, continues to voice reluctance about replacing the cabinet before parliamentary elections are held.
