New forensic committee will re-examine El-Gendy death
Following two contradictory autopsy reports on late activist Mohamed El-Gendy, a new forensic committee is to be formed to re-examine the case and establish a cause of death
Cairo prosecution has decided to form a new forensics committee to re-examine the case of slain activist Mohamed El-Gendy. The new committee will include five academic members, including a professor of neurology.
The initial forensic report issued 12 February claimed that El-Gendy, 28, a political activist and member of the Popular Current, died because of injuries sustained in an alleged car accident 28 January.
El-Gendy was missing for several days, turning up at a hospital unconscious and showing signs, according to friends and family, of extensive torture.
Amid controversy following his death and the reports of doctors assigned by the Popular Current to check El-Gendy when alive but in a coma, Qasr El-Nil Prosecution ordered the formation of a forensic committee to examine El-Gendy and issue another report.
The forensic committee, made of three members from autopsy authority and academics, reached the conclusion that the late activist's body showed injuries consistent with beating and torture.
