President Morsi to meet Port Said delegation Thursday
Mohamed Morsi is slated to meet local residents of the northern Egyptian city of Port Said Thursday to address their demands
President Mohamed Morsi is set to meet Thursday with a delegation of Port Said residents at the presidential headquarters in east Cairo's Heliopolis district.
The delegation will include regional government officials as well as representatives of the families of victims from recent violence in the city.
In a statement Wednesday, the presidential office said the meeting is aimed at addressing all demands of the Port Said people, whether economic, social or security-related.
Grievances of injustice and marginalisation have been growing in the Suez Canal city, a flashpoint of protest since January. The handing down of death sentences to 21 local residents for their part in the killing of more than 70 Al-Ahly club fans in Egypt's worst football disaster in February 2012 sparked violence and calls for civil disobedience.
More than 50 people have been killed and hundreds more injured in the aftermath of clashes against the court verdict issued in January.
On Saturday, a court confirmed the death sentences of those earlier found guilty and sentenced 24 others to jail, provoking further violence from residents who complain of being scapegoated.
