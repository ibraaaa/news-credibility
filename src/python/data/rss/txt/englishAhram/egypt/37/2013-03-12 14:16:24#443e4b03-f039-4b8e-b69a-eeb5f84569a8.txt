Presidency supports interior ministry amid security vacuum: Spokesman
Amid police labour strikes, calls for the interior minister to be sacked and protests that turn into clashes, presidential Spokesman Fahmy calls for respect for the law
Presidential Spokesman Ehab Fahmy declares that the presidency seeks to provide all the required support and assistance to the interior ministry, answering police labour strikes demonstrating against the ministry and the frequent protests-turned clashes.
Fahmy asserts that maintaining security is the responsibility of the interior ministry, reports MENA, Egypt's official news agency.
"Egypt is under circumstances that require the collaboration of all efforts to regain the trust between the citizens and the police institution. This is [achieved] by respecting the law – not undermining the police's role and disturbing state security," Fahmy asserts.
Earlier on Friday, police stations across Egypt - reportedly 30 of them  - shut their doors to demand that the interior minister be sacked and to oppose the 'Brotherhoodisation' of the ministry.
Egypt has been rocked by weeks of sporadic violence and widespread calls for civil disobedience amid mounting discontent with the performance of the Islamist-led government.
A verdict in the trial of the deadly attack during a football match in Port Said stadium flared the security problem in Cairo as the Egyptian Football Association headquarters was set on fire on Saturday.
The trial has triggered weeks of mounting unrest in Egypt, which is already grappling with mass protests due many being suffocated by the economy, and out of frustration that on the second-year anniversary of the revolution on 25 January major demands have yet to be fulfilled.
Suez Canal City launched a civil disobedience campaign for almost a week, the Nile Delta city of Mahalla joined them on Sunday and nearby Mansoura, also in Gharbiya governorate,  joined on Monday.
