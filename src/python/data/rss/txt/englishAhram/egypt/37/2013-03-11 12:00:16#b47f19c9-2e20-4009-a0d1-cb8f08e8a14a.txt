Lawyer launches case to strip Morsi's children of US citizenship
US can use the American passports of President Morsi's son and daughter to conspire against Egypt, argues lawsuit up for review Monday
Cairo's emergency court will look into the lawsuit that seeks to revoke the American citizenship of Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi's son and daughter on Monday.
Their passport, argues attorney Tarek Mahmoud who filed the case, can be a means by which the United States can conspire against Egypt.
Mahmoud filed the lawsuit in 2012 to revoke Shaimaa and Osama Morsi's American citizenship, who were born in the US while their father was working as professor at California State University in North Ridge between 1982 – 1985.
Article 134 of Egypt’s constitution dictates that the president must be an Egyptian citizen and both parents must also be Egyptian and furthermore cannot hold any other citizenship.
The article also specifies that the president cannot be married to a non-Egyptian; however, there is in nothing in the constitution regarding the children's nationality.
In April, presidential candidate Hazem Salah Abu Ismail was disqualified after it was discovered that his mother has an American passport – something he continues to deny.
Controversy is starting to surround Morsi’s children after Omar Morsi, son of the president, obtained a job at the Egypt Airports and Air Navigation Holding Company, with rumours circulating that he was given a massive salary.
Omar later turned the job down, announcing that his monthly salary would have only amounted to some LE900 ($130).
