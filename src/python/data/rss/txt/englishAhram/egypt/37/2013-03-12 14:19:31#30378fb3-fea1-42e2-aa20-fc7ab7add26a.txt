British Minister for Middle East to visit Egypt on Wednesday
UK Middle East Minister Alistair Burt is to visit Egypt on Wednesday to address pressing regional issues
British Minister for the Middle East Alistair Burt is scheduled to visit Egypt on Wednesday, 13 March.
Burt is programmed to meet with Egypt's Foreign Minister Mohamed Kamel Amr and leading Egyptian officials to review a number of pressing regional issues, including the Middle East peace process and the stalemate in Israeli-Palestinian negotiations.
The two-day visit will be the second in the past few weeks, as Burt visited Egypt in mid-January but did not meet with Egyptian foreign minister due to unexpected developments, including the Algerian hostage crisis.
