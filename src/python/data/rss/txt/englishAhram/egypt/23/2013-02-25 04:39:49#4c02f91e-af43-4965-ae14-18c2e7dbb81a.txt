Qandil tells opposition to stop providing cover for 'vandals'
Prime minister Qandil said that people take time to understand democracy
Prime Minister Hisham Qandil demanded that Egyptian political powers and parties end "their political cover" for "vandals" during a meeting on Monday with Egyptian newspaper editors-in-chief to discuss economic developments.
The prime minister also stated that economic stability in the country will provide the youth with more job opportunities.
Qandil said that the country was currently facing a lot of challenges and that Egypt should look to other countries' experiences in similar circumstances when considering how to move forward.
He also said that the values of democracy are not limited to elections, and that democratic values take a long time to be understood by everyone in society.
In a television interview on Sunday, President Mohamed Morsi said that the protests and strikes Egypt is currently experiencing, despite being part of freedom of expression, were hurting investments and the Egyptian economy.
A number of anti-government protests have been taking place in Egypt recently, including a large-scale civil disobedience campaign in Port Said which started last week, and similar campaigns in the Delta cities of Mansoura and Mahalla starting this weekend.
The Egyptian stock market dropped on Monday for the second consecutive day following the protests.
