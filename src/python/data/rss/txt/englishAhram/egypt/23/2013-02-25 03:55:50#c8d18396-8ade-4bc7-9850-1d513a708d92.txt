Clashes over calls for civil disobedience in Egypt's Nile Delta
Security forces fire teargas in Nile Delta city of Mansoura as clashes continue amid calls for civil disobedience
The clashes took place in front of the governorate headquarters, as protesters attempted to stop employees from entering the building.
Security forces used large amounts of teargas, leaving several protesters with breathing difficulties.
The calls for civil disobedience in the Nile Delta city started on Saturday when anti-government protesters blocked off the main roads in the city, including building a wall in one place to stop traffic.
Flyers were distributed across the city calling for the campaign, although those behind the calls did not identify themselves. The flyers stressed that the campaign is a legitimate way for citizens to peacefully express their grievances.
The governor of Gharbiya, Judge Mohamed Abdel-Qader, denied that civil disobedience had been taking place in Mansoura, stressing that the work is moving smoothly in all the cities of the governorates and all governmental institutes.
Prime Minister Hisham Qandil, speaking on Sunday, also denied any incidents of civil disobedience in any Egyptian city.
Recently, residents of the Suez Canal city of Port Said launched a civil disobedience for almost a week in protest as what they described as increased marginalisation as well as the death sentences handed to 21 locals in the Port Said football killings trial.
In the Nile Delta city of Mahalla, also in Gharbiya governorate, hundreds went on strike and blockaded the main routes into the city on Sunday as part of a campaign of civil disobedience.
A campaign of civil disobedience was also carried out in the village of Tahsin in Daqahliya governorate in September 2012, in protest at government neglect and a lack of infrastructure.
