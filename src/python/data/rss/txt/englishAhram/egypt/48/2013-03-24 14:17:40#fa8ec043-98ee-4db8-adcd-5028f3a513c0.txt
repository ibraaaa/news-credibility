Egypt court to issue verdict on parliamentary elections
Supreme Administrative Court to issue verdict on appeals against suspension of parliamentary elections on Sunday afternoon
The Supreme Administrative Court will on Sunday deliver its verdict on appeals against the suspension of parliamentary elections.
The appeals were submitted by the Egyptian State Lawsuit Authority on behalf of the presidency, and by former MP Mohamed El-Omda.
The verdict was initially set to come out on 17 March but was postponed.
On 6 March, the Supreme Administrative Court overturned a presidential decree calling for parliamentary elections to begin on 22 April, questioning the constitutionality of the electoral law.
The High Constitutional Court (HCC) had rejected five of the electoral law's articles on 18 February. The law was referred back to the Shura Council, which partially amended the legislation without referring it back to the HCC for final approval. President Mohamed Morsi then issued a decree stating parliamentary polls would be held in late April.
An administrative court ruling said the Shura Council should have referred the electoral law back to the HCC before ratifying it, so as to ensure the amendments were constitutional.
On Sunday, Egypt’s office of state commissioners, a judicial body responsible for issuing non-binding recommendations to the courts, called for the appeals against the suspension of elections to be rejected.
