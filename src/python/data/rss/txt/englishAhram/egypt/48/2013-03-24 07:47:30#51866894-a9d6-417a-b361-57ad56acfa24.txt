Egypt's Salafist Front accuses opposition leaders of inciting violence
Salafist front charges Constitution Party founder Mohamed ElBaradei, Egyptian Popular Current founder Hamdeen Sabbahi of inciting violence against Muslim Brotherhood
Egypt's Salafist Front lodged a complaint with the prosecutor-general on Sunday against 38 prominent opposition figures, including Hamdeen Sabbahi and Mohamed ElBaradei, who it accuses of inciting violence by calling for Friday's protests outside the Muslim Brotherhood's headquarters in Cairo's Moqattam district.
The complaint, filed by Khaled El-Masry, a member of the front's political bureau, also accused several political and media figures of inciting violence, including Hazem Abdel-Azim, lawyer Khaled Ali, television presenter Buthaina Kamel and activists Alaa Abdel-Fattah and Asmaa Mahfouz, along with 40 members of the opposition Egyptian Popular Current movement and Constitution Party.
Clashes erupted on Friday in several parts of the country between supporters and opponents of the Brotherhood, leaving at least 200 injured.
On Saturday, Prosecutor-General Talaat Abdullah ordered investigations into complaints filed by Muslim Brotherhood lawyers against 14 political figures and parties accused of inciting violence against the Islamist group.
