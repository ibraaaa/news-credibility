Ultras Ahlawy groups protest at Giza security directorate
Ultras members protest at Giza security directorate as part of growing pressure against Egypt's interior ministry, ahead of Port Said football trail on 9 March
Members of Egypt's Ultras Ahlawy groups protested on Wednesday at the Giza security directorate, as a sign of escalation against the Ministry of Interior, ahead of the Port Said stadium clashes court verdict scheduled for 9 March.
At least five-thousand Ultras members gathered in protest at the Giza security directorate, chanting "Be afraid of us government," and drawing graffiti on the wall of the directorate.
The angry young protesters threw fireworks at the police building and set on fire an empty police truck parked outside.
On Tuesday, another group of Ultras Ahlawy organised marches to the houses of former and current ministers of interior to demand for retribution from the interior ministry and apply pressure on the ministry before the court verdict, according to the official Ultras Ahlawy Facebook page.
On 9 March, the New Cairo criminal court will issue its second verdict on the Port Said stadium clashes where nearly 72 Ahly fans, mostly from Ultras group, were killed on 1 February, 2012.
