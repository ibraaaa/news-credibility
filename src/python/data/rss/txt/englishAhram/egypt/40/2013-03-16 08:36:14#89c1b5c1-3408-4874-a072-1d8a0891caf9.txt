ElBaradei praises UN declaration fighting violence against women
Opposition figure Mohamed ElBaradei calls for implementation of the recently-adopted UN document, which the Muslim Brotherhood had criticised
Liberal opposition figure and founder of the Constitution Party Mohamed ElBaradei expressed his satisfaction with the recently-ratified UN document combating violence against women.
"Adoption by consensus, including Arab & Muslim states, of declaration on violence against women. Challenge now is to put words into action," the reform campaigner wrote in English on his Twitter account on Saturday.
On Friday, the UN's Commission on the Status of Women in New York ratified a new declaration entitled 'End Violence Against Women.'
Egyptian representatives included Mervat Tellawy, head of the National Council for Women, and the president's assistant for political affairs Pakinam El-Sharkawi.
Tellawy, who headed the Egyptian delegation in New York, said that the declaration will be implemented in accordance with national legislation, and will take into consideration the traditions of each society.
While the presidency too had expressed its rejection of violence against women, the Muslim Brotherhood had vehemently criticised the declaration, saying that it conflicted with Islamic law and aimed to destroy the family in the Muslim world.
The Brotherhood objected to a number of clauses, including one that enables wives to file legal reports in the case of marital rape, and others promoting the rights of homosexuals and of equal rights of inheritance for men and women.
The Brotherhood, from which President Mohamed Morsi hails, further urged the leaders of Islamic countries and their UN representatives to reject and condemn the document.
