Egypt's Ultras besiege former interior minister's residence
Hundreds of hardcore football fans gather at Dokki residence of former interior minister Mohamed Ibrahim, ahead of second verdict in the Port Said football trials
Hundreds of Ahly football club fans, known as the Ultras Ahlawy, besieged the residence of former interior minister Mohamed Ibrahim Tuesday evening in the district of Dokki in Giza.
Protesters destroyed the entrance to the minister's house, shooting fireworks at it, while police forces fired shots into the air in an attempt to disperse them. At the time of going to press, the situation was tense and the crowds had not been dispersed.
The hardcore fan group announced earlier on Tuesday that its members were marching separately on the residences of former and current interior ministers to apply pressure ahead of a key court verdict.
A second verdict is expected on Saturday in the trials related to the Port Said football killings in February 2012 in which over 70 Ahly fans were killed after a football match.
"Our members are currently partaking in two separate marches on the houses of former and current interior ministers, during the tenure of whom the ministry did not change and continued to kill people with impunity," said the group on its official Facebook page Tuesday afternoon.
"We remind everyone that if retribution is not attained [by the verdict] we will attain it with our own hands," the statement concluded.
Mohamed Ibrahim was minister of interior at the time of the Port Said events. The current minister of interior who replaced him is also called Mohamed Ibrahim.
On 26 January, a court sentenced 21 defendants to death in relation to the killings; some of the men convicted belonged to the Ultras fan group of Port Said football club Masry.
