Iraq issues blanket pardon for detained Egyptian nationals
Within context of PM Hisham Qandil's visit to Baghdad, Iraq declares amnesty for all Egyptians currently detained by Iraqi authorities; 33 Egyptian prisoners expected to benefit from decision
Iraqi Prime Minister Nour Al-Maliki on Monday issued a blanket pardon for all Egyptian nationals currently detained by Iraqi authorities.
Al-Maliki's decision came during a visit to Iraq by his Egyptian counterpart Hisham Qandil aimed at discussing means of fostering greater economic cooperation between the two Arab nations.
Around 33 Egyptians currently detained by Iraqi authorities are expected to benefit from El-Malki's decision.
Released detainees will reportedly be free to leave Iraq and return to their native Egypt.
Last October, the Iraqi government announced the formation of a committee to discuss the possibility of a prisoner-exchange deal with Egypt.
