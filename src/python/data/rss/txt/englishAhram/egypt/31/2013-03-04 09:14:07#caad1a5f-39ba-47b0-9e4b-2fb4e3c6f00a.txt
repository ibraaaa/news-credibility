VIDEO: Another police vehicle torched on Cairo's October bridge
Traffic on Sixth October Bridge halted for nearly half an hour after police vehicle was set ablaze
According to Ahram Arabic news website, the driver ran away from the vehicle before being caught by the protesters.
Chanting "the ministry of interior are thugs," they torched the vehicle, causing a complete traffic standstill on the bridge for nearly half an hour.
According to Ahram Online reporter Simon Hanna,
some protesters were playing drums and singing songs associated with the Ahly Ultras fans group.
A ministry of interior microbus was also set on fire near Qasr El-Nil Bridge by unknown individuals on Monday evening, also in downtown Cairo.
Late Sunday, Ahram Arabic website reported that a police vehicle was set on fire by a number of rioters near Abdel Moneim Riyad Square, one of the entrances leading to Tahrir Square, before Central Security Forces responded with teargas.
The torching of police vehicles comes after security forces cracked down on tents on Tahrir Square earlier on Sunday, evacuating peaceful protesters.
