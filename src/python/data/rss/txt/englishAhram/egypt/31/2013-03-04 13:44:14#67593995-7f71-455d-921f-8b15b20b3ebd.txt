Police guards strike at Egyptian state TV building Maspero
Approximately 300 police security guards block all entrances to the state Maspero television building in labour dispute; 700 more are expected to strike
Hundreds of protesting police security guards at the state Maspero television complex in downtown Cairo closed the main entrances to all buildings by 11am Monday, refusing entry to all staff and workers.
Security guards say the administration hasn't fully kept their promises of an annual wage increase and also to remove a 2 percent medical care deduction, both of which were supposed to come into effect in 2013.
A police guard on strike at Maspero tells Ahram Online that according to the wages and salaries structure put in place for 2013, all workers and staff at Maspero were to see a salary increase. While other staff received the complete raise, security guards only received half of the expected raise.
He details that around 300 morning shift security guards are currently on strike. The police guard believes the numbers will increase throughout the day as the remaining guards out of the total 1000 in Maspero join the strike.  
The guards had already warned that if by February they did not receive their entitled wage increase they would step up their action and strike.
