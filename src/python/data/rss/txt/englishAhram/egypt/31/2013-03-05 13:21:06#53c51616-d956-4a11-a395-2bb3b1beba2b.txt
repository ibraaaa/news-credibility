Egyptian 'eye-sniper' police officer sentenced to three years
Mahmoud El-Shinnawy, accused of deliberately shooting at protesters' eyes during the Mohamed Mahmoud clashes in November 2011, is sentenced to three years in prison
A court in Cairo has sentenced First Lieutenant Mahmoud El-Shinnawy – the so-called 'eye sniper' – to three years in prison for deliberately shooting at protesters' eyes during the Mohamed Mahmoud Street clashes in November 2011.
El-Shinnawy was tried for attempted murder for targeting the eyes of five protesters with birdshot.
The Central Security Forces lieutenant became known as the 'eye-sniper' after a
video
circulated on the internet of El-Shinnawy deliberately targeting the eyes of protesters during the clashes.
Around 40 people were killed in the Mohamed Mahmoud clashes in November 2011 when police and unarmed protesters fought running battles near the interior ministry in downtown Cairo.
