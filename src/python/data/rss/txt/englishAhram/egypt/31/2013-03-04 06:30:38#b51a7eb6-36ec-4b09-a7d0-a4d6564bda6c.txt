Guards at Egypt's state TV building end strike after meeting information minister
Security guards at state TV building in Cairo's Maspero district call off strike action after Egypt's information minister agrees to implement promised pay raises
A security official at the state-run Egyptian Radio and Television Union (ERTU) building in Cairo's Maspero district announced on Monday afternoon that all entrances into the building had been opened following a meeting between striking security guards and Information Minister Salah Abdel-Maqsoud.
Some 300 security guards on Monday morning blocked the building's main entrances to protest the ERTU's failure to implement promised salary increases, which they say had been supposed to go into effect this year.
One striking guard told Ahram Online early Monday that, according to the salary structure set for the current year, all of the building's workers and staff were meant to receive salary increases. While some members of the staff received the promised raise, however, security guards say that they only received half of the expected increase.
Abdel-Maqsoud asserted that all the building's workers – including security guards – would see the promised wage increases this month.
Following their meeting with the minister on Monday morning, striking guards agreed to halt the strike action.
Approximately 1000 guards work at the ERTU building.
