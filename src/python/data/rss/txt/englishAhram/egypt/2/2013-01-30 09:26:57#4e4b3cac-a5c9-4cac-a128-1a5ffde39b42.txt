Salafist Nour Party, NSF call for unity government
Salafist Nour Party and National Salvation Front (NSF) announce 8-point plan to end Egypt's political crisis
Egypt's National Salvation Front (NSF), the main opposition bloc, and the Salafist Nour Party agreed on a unified initiative that aims to end Egypt's ongoing political crisis, following a meeting held in Cairo on Wednesday.
The initiative includes eight terms, in which the main condition is to form a unity government that includes the representation of opposition groups.
"The agreement comes, as both sides (NSF and Nour Party) see that Egypt's political situation has escalated to an alarming level, as the initiative's goal is to protect the public interest and end future bloodshed," explained the press statement issued after the meeting.
The eight-points of the agreement that came in the press statement are:
Point 1: Form a unity government
Point 2: Form a committee to amend controversial articles in the constitution
Point 3: Non-partisanship of all state institutions
Point 4: Appointment of a new prosecutor-general
Point 5: Form a judicial committee to investigate recent violence
Point 6: Form a consensus between all parties to lead the country, prohibiting the domination of a single faction over political life
Point 7: Reject all forms of violence or vandalism of public property, and respect the right to peaceful protest and demonstrations
Point 8: Establish a code of political behaviour agreed upon by all parties to end the verbal warfare between politicians that affects everyone's political image.
