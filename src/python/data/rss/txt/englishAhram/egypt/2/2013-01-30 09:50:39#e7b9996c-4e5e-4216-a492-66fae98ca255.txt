Curfew reduced in Suez to 3 hours
Samir Aglan, the governor of Suez, decided to reduce the curfew period to three hours, beginning from 2am until 5 am.
The decision came after consultations with Maj. Gen. Osama Askar, the commander of the Third Army in charge of Suez, and security director of the governorate major-general Adel Refaat.
Thousands of residents have organised mass nightly rallies to break the curfew that was imposed on Sunday on all three Suez Canal cities by President Mohamed Morsi in the wake of bloody clashes in the city that left eight civilians and two officers dead last Friday.
Ismailia has already reduced its curfew to three hours earlier Wednesday afternoon.
