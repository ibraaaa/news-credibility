Clashes erupt in Cairo's Shubra district after 15-year-old boy allegedly stabbed to death by son of Salafist activist
Two people died during clashes in Cairo's Shubra district on Monday night.
The violence broke out after Saad Dorra, 15, was killed during a football match at a school in Shubra, a working class district of the Egyptian capital.
The killer was reportedly the son of Gamal Saber, coordinator of Must Be Hazem

– a group supporting former Salafist presidential candidate Hazem Salah Abu-Ismail.
Around 200 people, including the dead boy's relatives, clashed with the alleged killer's relatives shortly before midnight on Monday, firing bird shot, throwing Molotov cocktails and wielding bladed weapons, Al-Ahram Arabic reported.
Seventy private cars were smashed and four shops were attacked during the violence.
At least two people were killed in the clashes and others were injured by bird shot, a senior interior ministry official told state news agency MENA.
Central Security Forces (CSF) and armoured vehicles were deployed in the area when clashes resumed at around 3am on Tuesday.
