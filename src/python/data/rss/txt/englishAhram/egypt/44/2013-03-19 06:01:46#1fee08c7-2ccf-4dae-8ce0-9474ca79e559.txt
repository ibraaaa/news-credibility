Former Libyan ambassador arrested in Cairo
Former ambassador Ali Maria is wanted by Interpol for crimes related to the Gaddafi regime in Libya
Former Libyan ambassador to Egypt Ali Maria was arrested on Tuesday morning in Cairo.
Maria, who was ambassador under deposed leader Muammar Gaddafi, is accused of a number of crimes related to the former Libyan regime and is currently wanted by the Libyan government.
After several hours of negotiations at his residence in Sheikh Ziyad, a satellite city on the western outskirts of Cairo, Maria handed himself over to security forces.
The Egyptian authorities will hand him over to Interpol.
Ahmed Gadhaf Al-Dam, a close aide and cousin of former Libyan ruler Gaddafi, was also arrested in Cairo on Tuesday.
The new Libyan administration has been demanding the extradition of Gadhaf Al-Dam and Maria from Egypt to face trials for alleged involvement in crimes during the Gaddafi era.
