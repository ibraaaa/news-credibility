3 Gaddafi regime figures arrested in Cairo
Egyptian authorities and Interpol arrested 3 Libyan former officials in Cairo, all wanted by the new Libyan government
Ahmed Gadhaf Al-Dam, a cousin of and former close aide to deposed ruler Muammar Gaddafi, was arrested at his residence in Zamalek, reportedly after a small clash between his guards and the police.
Ali Maria, the former Libyan ambassador to Egypt, was arrested a few hours later. Maria, who has been accused in a number of crimes related to the former Gaddafi regime, handed himself over at his residence in Sheikh Ziyad, on the outskirts of Cairo, after three hours of negotiations with security forces.
Mohamed Ibrahim, the brother of former Libyan minister of information Moussa Ibrahim was also arrested on Tuesday in Cairo.
The men are currently being detained by Egyptian authorities; prosecutors decided to extend the detention of Gadhaf Al-Dam for 30 days.
The new Libyan administration has been demanding the extradition of Gadhaf Al-Dam and Maria as well other Libyan figures close to Gaddafi's regime from Egypt, to face trials for alleged involvement in crimes during the Gaddafi era.
Gadhaf Al-Dam's lawyers told Egyptian prosecutors that his arrest on the orders of Interpol was illegal, as he holds an Egyptian passport. He was reportedly born in Marsa Matrouh governorate to an Egyptian mother and Libyan father in 1952.
Gadhaf Al-Dam's lawyers also claim that the former coordinator of Egyptian Libyan relations defected from his cousin's regime in the early days of the Libyan revolution, in objection to the killing of protesters.
According to news reports, Gadhaf Al-Dam is also facing charges under Egyptian law of possessing illegal arms at his residence.
