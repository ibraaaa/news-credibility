Eye on the revolution: Maha Gahallah, a Nubian tale
In this ten-part series, Ahram Online asks those who took part in the 25 January Revolution what they make of Egypt's current political situation two years after Mubarak's departure
It was only in her mid-twenties that Maha Gahallah found ‘once and for all’ her Nubian roots, and it was from there that she embarked on politics – ‘but always with a human face.’ After all, this is why she went from a banker to a civil society worker.
Today, Gahallah is still trying to introduce this ‘human face’ into politics, arguing that Egypt must focus on development beyond the current state of polarisation.
