Egypt's women organise Wednesday march against sexual harassment
A march to Tahrir Square will take place to highlight the issue of sexual assault
Egyptian women's rights groups and activists are organising a march on Wednesday at 4pm to highlight the issue of sexual harassment and assault in Egypt.
Sexual assaults on women in Tahrir Square are common during large protests and demonstrations, with around 25 being reported on 25 January, the second anniversary of the revolution.
Yasmin El-Borhamy, an activist who was sexually assaulted by a gang in Mohamed Mahmoud Street off Tahrir Square, recounted her experiences on private television channel Al-Nahar, saying that a large group of men, some armed with knives, tore off her clothes and sexually assaulted her.
The march will take place from Sayyeda Zeinab Mosque to Tahrir Square.
