New Salafist party takes final step towards official recognition
Watan Party, formed by disaffected members of Salafist Nour Party, submits authorisation papers with court in Cairo
The Salafist Watan Party has submitted its authorisation papers to the party affairs committee at the Supreme Court in Cairo.
The party was recently formed by disaffected members of the Salafist Nour Party. Its leader is Emad Abdel-Ghafour, a former Nour Party chairman.
The party is organising and selecting candidates to stand in upcoming parliamentary elections, Abdel-Ghafour said on Tuesday after handing in the papers.
Abdel-Ghafour said the party's programme was drafted by experts and would aim to fulfil the goals of the revolution – bread, freedom, social justice and human dignity.
"We have opened thirty party offices already, with more to come in the coming days," Abdel-Ghafour claimed.
Meanwhile, deputy leader Yousri Hammad said the party was against polarisation among Egyptians, and would aim to unite all qualified national figures without discrimination.
In January, Hammad announced the party would welcome Coptic Christian and female members, unlike the Nour Party which was against women’s participation in politics. 
Prior to his resignation from the Nour Party, Abdel-Ghafour represented what was dubbed its reformist camp. He reportedly quit following a dispute with followers of influential cleric Yasser El-Borhami, a founder of the Salafist Call, which established the Nour Party in 2011.
The Salafist Call, the largest and most influential Salafist movement in Egypt, has said the Nour Party remains its sole political arm.
Former Salafist presidential hopeful Hazem Salah Abu-Ismail, who is establishing his own party, has announced he will form an electoral alliance with the Watan Party in the upcoming parliamentary elections.
No official date has been set for the parliamentary elections. However, official statements suggest it will be held in April.
