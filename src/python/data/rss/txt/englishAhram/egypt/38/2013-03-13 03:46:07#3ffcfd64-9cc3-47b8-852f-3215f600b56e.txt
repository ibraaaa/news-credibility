Egypt electoral commission denies appealing parliament poll delay
Spokesman for Supreme Electoral Commission denies responsibility for appeal lodged against court verdict suspending Egypt's second post-revolution parliamentary polls
Egypt's Supreme Electoral Commission on (SEC) released a statement on Wednesday denying that it had filed an appeal against a 6 March Supreme Administrative Court (SAC) ruling suspending a presidential decision calling for parliamentary elections in April.
The statement, signed by SEC spokesman Hisham Mokhtar, came shortly after a formal appeal was filed against the 6 March SAC verdict, which suspended the parliamentary elections doubting the constitutionality of the election law.
According to Al-Ahram's Arabic-language news website, the presidency, justice ministry and head of the Shura Council (the upper house of Egypt's parliament, currently endowed with legislative powers) – and not the SEC – are the state bodies that have formally appealed the administrative court ruling suspending President Mohamed Morsi's calls for parliamentary polls.
