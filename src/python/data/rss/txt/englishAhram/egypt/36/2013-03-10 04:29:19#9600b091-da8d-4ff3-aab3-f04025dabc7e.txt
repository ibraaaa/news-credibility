A rocket left over from Israeli-Egypt wars exploded approximately 45 kilometres from central Sinai's Nakhl city, eyewitnesses reported on Sunday.
According to security sources, the rocket was made in Israel; the explosion blasted a hole two metres deep in the ground and one and a half kilometre wide. 
According to Ahram Arabic Online, a military unit dispatched to the site of the explosion reported there had been no injuries.
On Saturday, Egypt's interior ministry raised the state of emergency in northern and southern Sinai after security forces "received information that jihadist groups intend to launch attacks on police institutions in the strategic peninsula."
