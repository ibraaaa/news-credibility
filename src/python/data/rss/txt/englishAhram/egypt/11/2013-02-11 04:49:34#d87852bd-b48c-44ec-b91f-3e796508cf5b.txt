Ghad Al-Thawra rejects Nour's membership in Conscience Front
Leading members of liberal opposition party Ghad Al-Thawra demand the withdrawal of their leader, Ayman Nour, from the new Islamist-dominated front
The high commission of the Ghad Al-Thawra Party has said it opposes the participation of its leader, Ayman Nour, in the National Conscience Front (NCF).
In a statement published on Monday, the party said it opposed the move because it put the party on the side of the Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party (FJP), whereas the party should maintain a more centrist position.
Deputy leader Mohamed Mohieddin said the term "conscience front" was exclusionary and suggested those who did not take part were without conscience.
Political bureau chief Shadi Taha announced he would not take part in the party's general assembly meeting due to Nour's participation in the front.
It is unacceptable for an opposition liberal party like Ghad Al-Thawra to take part in an initiative which brings together parties and figures of the ruling regime, Taha added.
Taha stated he would not take part in any further meetings until the party withdraws from the front.
The NCF includes a significant number of Islamist figures including former minister of state for parliamentary affairs Mohamed Mahsoub, Wasat Party deputy leader Essam Soltan, and FJP figures Mohamed El-Beltagi and Helmy El-Gazzar.
Other members include legal expert Ramadan Bateekh, Judges for Egypt leader Walid Shoraby, former presidential candidate Mohamed Selim El-Awa, Ghad Al-Thawra Party leader Ayman Nour, and MP Mohamed Mohieddin.
The front said its goals were to put an end to the bloodshed currently taking place in the country and help Egypt develop and achieve the goals of the January 25 Revolution.
