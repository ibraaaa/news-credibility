Fresh skirmishes erupt outside Egypt's Presidential Palace
Dozens of Egyptian protesters clash with Presidential Guard units in fresh round of violence outside President Morsi's official headquarters
Egyptian Central Security Forces have begun firing teargas canisters at protesters arrayed outside the Presidential Palace on Merghani Street in Cairo's Heliopolis district, pushing the latter towards the nearby Roxy Square.
Skirmishes erupted shortly before 8pm outside the palace between hundreds of protesters and Presidential Guard personnel.
According to Al-Ahram's Arabic-language news website, the Presidential Guard began spraying protesters with water hoses after several protesters attempted to remove barbed wire surrounding the palace.
A number of protesters responded by hurling rocks at security personnel.
Intermittent clashes outside the palace were seen throughout much of last week. The most violent of these clashes occurred late last month – on the second anniversary of Egypt's January 25 Revolution – in which at least two people were reported killed.
