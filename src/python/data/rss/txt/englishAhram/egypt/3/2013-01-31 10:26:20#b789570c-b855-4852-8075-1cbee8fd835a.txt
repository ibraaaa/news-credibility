Egypt's presidency welcomes Al-Azhar initiative
Egypt's presidential office welcomes Al-Azhar's initiative where political and religious figures denounce violence and uphold national dialogue to resolve current crisis
President Mohamed Morsi has welcomed a meeting between political forces and religious representatives at Egypt's Al-Azhar after the latter announced an initiative aimed at resolving the recent political unrest.
In a Thursday statement, the presidency said it welcomed the positive results of the initiative, specifically its call to reject violence in all its forms and "valued" the initiative's request to set in motion a national dialogue.
Many political figures, including prominent opposition leaders Mohamed ElBaradei and Hamdeen Sabbahi, attended the Azhar meeting. The discussion ended with points stressing on the sanctity of human life, the denunciation of violence and the need for a national dialogue to resolve outstanding political differences.
The presidency said the meeting is an important step for achieving stability in Egypt.
Egypt has been rocked by deadly clashes and riots over the past week after protests sparked on the revolution's anniversary turned violent, especially after a court verdict handed death sentences to 21 people involved in last year's Port Said football disaster.
The recent wave of violence across the country left at least 50 dead.
