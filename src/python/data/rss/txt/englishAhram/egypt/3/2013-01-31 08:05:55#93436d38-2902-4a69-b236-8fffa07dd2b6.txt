Brotherhood announces 'positive' results of 'Together we build Egypt' campaign
Amid widespread unrest across Egypt, the Muslim Brotherhood and its Freedom and Justice Party boast helping hundreds of thousands of citizens through medical, commercial, and environmental initiatives
Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood and its Freedom and Justice Party (FJP) announced their provision of medical help for over 230,000 citizens as part of their "Together we build Egypt" campaign launched on the second anniversary of the January 25 Revolution.
The Brotherhood – the group which nominated President Mohamed Morsi for presidency – presents its efforts in its plan to cure 1 million patients, as the country undergoes a period of instability after anti-government protests on the anniversary of Egypt's revolution led to deadly clashes exacerbated by a Port Said court order that left at least 50 dead.
According to the group's website, Ikhwan Online, the "Together we build Egypt" campaign is also involved in construction, commercial and environmental work. The group carried out maintenance work in 1,123 schools, organised 541 markets selling commodities at cost which – according to Ikhwan Online – helped over 340,000 citizens.
During the past week, President Morsi came under fire for failing to provide a political solution for the unrest, accusing him of resorting to security measures which would do nothing to alleviate the causes behind public anger. A curfew in the restive Suez Canal cities which the president announced on Sunday was staunchly defied by large protests organised by local residents.
Nevertheless, the violence failed to hinder the Brotherhood from planting 145,493 trees in many provinces across Egypt; an image sharply contrasting footage of burning cars, occupied government buildings and skirmishes between security, protesters and rioters in many cities, which flooded television channels over the last week.
The Brotherhood and the FJP invited other political groups to join their initiative, urging them to do "positive work" that would "benefit the Egyptian people."
Meanwhile, dozens of political groups have called for the continuation of protests on Friday.
