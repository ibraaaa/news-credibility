Egypt's prosecutor-general hints at new former regime charges
Justice Talaat Abdullah says 'new information' related to corruption by former regime members will be released soon
Egypt’s prosecutor-general Talaat Abdullah stated on Thursday that in the upcoming weeks, ongoing investigations are set to reveal "important information" involving a number of former regime members. He did not, however, mention who specifically would be targeted by these investigations.
Abdullah’s statements come at a time when several former regime figures are facing trials, including Safwat El-Sherif, former head of the Shura Council (parliament’s upper house) who was released on Thursday after being acquitted on charges of squandering public money. However, El-Sherif faces a number of other cases against him.
Deposed president Hosni Mubarak is currently serving life imprisonment, following his sentence on 2 June 2012, for complicity in the killing of protesters during the 25 January Revolution.
Several other former regime figures are being tried for a number of charges concerning the killing of protesters, profiteering and squandering of public money.
