BREAKING: Police fire teargas at anti-president demonstrators in Alexandria
Police fire tear gas to disperse demonstrations in front of Sidi Gaber police station
Clashes have erupted in the city of Alexandria between protesters and police in front of the Sidi Gaber police station. Police fired tear gas to disperse protesters, reported Al-Ahram's Arabic website. The two sides both threw stones.
The central street of Abu-Qir is now completely blocked as clashes continue. The security presence has intensified in the police station's vicinity.
Clashes have also erupted in several cities across Egypt including Tanta, Kafr El-Sheikh and Mahalla. 
Hundreds rallied in Alexandria answering a call for nationwide anti-government protests. Demonstrations also protested police brutality after several were reported tortured during last week's detentions and two were reported dead during clashes at the presidential palace.
Rallies in Cairo have so far remained peaceful.
