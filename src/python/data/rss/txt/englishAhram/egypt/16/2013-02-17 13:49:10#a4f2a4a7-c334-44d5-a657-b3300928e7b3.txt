FJP's Katatni, NSF's ElBaradei hold private meeting on political impasse
Closed-door meeting held Saturday between Saad El-Katatni and Mohamed ElBaradei is not linked with Nour Party's dialogue initiative, FJP claims
A private meeting was held late Saturday by head of the Freedom and Justice Party (FJP) Saad El-Katatni and opposition National Salvation Front (NSF) leader Mohamed ElBaradei, along with Sayed Badawi, Al-Wafd Party head.
NSF spokesperson Khaled Dawood told Ahram Online that the meeting was held late Saturday at ElBaradei's home to discuss the current political situation. As it was a private meeting, details of what was discussed are unknown.
Following the meeting, Katatni announced on his Twitter account that he had met with ElBaradei and Badawi.
In response, early Sunday, Salafist El-Nour Party spokesperson Nader Bakkar stated on his official Twitter account that it was a positive step in the national dialogue initiative, ahead of the expected second round of talks headed by El-Nour Party to take place soon.
But a statement published by the FJP early Sunday clarified that Saturday's meeting was not connected to the national dialogue initiative spearheaded by El-Nour Party.
