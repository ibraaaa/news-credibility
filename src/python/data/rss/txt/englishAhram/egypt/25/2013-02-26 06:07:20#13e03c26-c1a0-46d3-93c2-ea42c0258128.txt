Poll: 49% support Egypt's President Morsi; 35% unfamiliar with NSF
New poll by Cairo-based research agency shows decreasing support for President Mohamed Morsi, while whopping third of Egyptians don't appear to have heard of country's leading opposition faction
About 49 percent of Egyptians are satisfied with President Mohamed Morsi's performance, a new opinion poll has revealed, down from 53 percent in a similar poll last month.
Results of the survey, which was conducted by the Cairo-based Baseera Centre for Public Opinion Research, were published on Tuesday.
Poll results also revealed that 35 percent of those asked would re-elect Morsi as president if fresh elections were held tomorrow. This is compared to 39 percent in last month's poll, and 58 percent in a poll conducted following Morsi's first 100 days in office.
The latest poll also showed that about 35 per cent of those asked were unfamiliar with Egypt's main opposition umbrella group, the National Salvation Front (NSF).
Of those unfamiliar with the NSF, 45 per cent live in Egypt's countryside, while 24 percent reside in urban areas.
Of those respondents familiar with the NSF, 53 percent said they opposed the group, while 35 percent – most of them from Egypt's northern governorates – supported it.
The survey, conducted on 18 and 19 February via telephone, involved 2275 Egyptian respondents above the age of 18.
According to the Baseera centre, the latest poll has a roughly 3 percent margin of error.
