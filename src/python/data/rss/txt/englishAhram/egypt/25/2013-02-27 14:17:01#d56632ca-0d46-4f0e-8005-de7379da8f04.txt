Youth to dance the 'Harlem Shake' outside Egypt's Brotherhood HQ
Egyptian 'Facebook users' are planning to perform the 'Harlem Shake' dance craze outside the Muslim Brotherhood HQ on Thursday
A number of Facebook users have called for a public "Harlem Shake" on Thursday in front of the Muslim Brotherhood’s national headquarters in Cairo’s Moqattam district.
The so-called "Harlem Shake" is a popular dance craze which started on 2 February when a group of Australian teens uploaded a 31-second clip of them dancing to an excerpt of the song "Harlem Shake" by electronic musician Baauer.
Thousands of similar videos have since been uploaded, including one performed in front of the
pyramids
of Giza, performed on 23 February. The Egyptian performers faced opposition from the police when they carried out the stunt.
The event outside the Brotherhood headquarters is scheduled for 6pm; at the time of going to press, the number of attendees had reached 1,500. The organisers of the event stated on the Facebook page that they were motivated by "boredom."
The Muslim Brotherhood and their political wing, the Freedom and Justice Party (FJP), has been facing growing criticism from many quarters since the second anniversary of the 25 January revolution.
A number of FJP offices around the country were attacked or torched by demonstrators in the past two months.
Recently, a number of activists organised a football tournament in front of the Brotherhood’s headquarters under the banner “glory to the martyrs."
The Muslim Brotherhood expressed their concern about Thursday’s performance, with spokesman Mahmoud Ghozlan telling privately-owned newspaper Daily News Egypt that peaceful protests were welcome but that "such matters always lead to violence, which is unacceptable."
