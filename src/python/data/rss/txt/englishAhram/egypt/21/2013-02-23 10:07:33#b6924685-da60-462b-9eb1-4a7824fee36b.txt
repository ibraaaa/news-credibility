Prosecution orders detention of Bible-burning preacher for four days
Detention order against Bible-burning preacher, Abu-Islam, pending investigation into charges of insulting Christian Coptic women on TV
Egyptian prosecutors ordered controversial Islamist preacher Abu-Islam Ahmed Abdullah to be held in detention for four days detention pending investigation into an accusation of insulting Coptic Christian women on his TV show.
The office of the prosecutor-general has begun investigating Abu-Islam after he allegedly described Coptic Christian women as “whores” on his satellite television programme.
After the detention order, tens of Abu-Islam's supporters gathered in solidarity with him at the prosecutor-general's office, calling for his acquittal.
The complaint against Abu-Islam was filed by lawyer Naguib Gabriel.
Abu-Islam is also facing charges of defaming Christianity for burning copies of the New Testament.
Dozens of Abu-Islam’s supporters gathered in front of the Supreme Court on Saturday and chanted that the prosecutor-general is working for the Muslim Brotherhood. Security guards prevented them from entering the court.
Abu-Islam is the owner of the Umma and Mariya satellite television channels.
In a similar case, Egypt's Administrative Court recently ordered controversial Sheikh Abdullah Badr’s programme on the Al-Hafez religious channel to be taken off air for 30 days.
On 17 December, Badr was handed a one-year jail term and a LE20,000 fine for insulting the actress Elham Shahin on his show.
