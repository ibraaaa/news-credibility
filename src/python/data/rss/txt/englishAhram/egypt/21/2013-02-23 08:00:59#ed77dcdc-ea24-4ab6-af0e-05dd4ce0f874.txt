Wasat Party head supports reconciliation with ex-regime figures
Wasat Party head Abul-Ela Madi says publicised regulations and national dialogue must be the way for reconciling with former regime figures
Wasat Party leader Abul-Ela Madi stated at a conference on Saturday that he is for reconciling with former regime figures as long as it is based on transparent regulations. 
Reconciliation plans need, however, to be discussed openly in a national dialogue, he added at the conference held in the one of the social clubs in Sharqiya's city of Zagazig.
Madi also brushed off demands for early presidential elections, stressing that the majority's approval of the constitution, passed in December 2012, was also an implicit approval of President Mohamed Morsi continuing his four-year term. 
"The minority which seeks to campaign for that [early presidential elections] should instead work on creating a strong base upon which it can garner seats in the coming parliamentary elections," he said referring to opposition parties. 
Madi also revealed his party plans to establish a new television satellite channel which propagates "moderate Islam." 
In the 2011 parliamentary elections, the Wasat Party was able to garner ten seats. The party, which represents itself as moderate Islamist, was also represented in the constitution drafting committee.
