FJP will rebuild state institutions, create opportunities: Party spokesperson
Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party will rebuild Egypt's state institutions and create opportunities for the average citizen, vows party spokesperson
The Freedom and Justice Party will rebuild state institutions and provide opportunities for the average citizen, party spokesperson Mourad Ali has said.
Our agenda is crystal clear; we want to achieve stability through the building of state institutions, Mourad said via Facebook on Thursday. We will also help the average citizen overcome the economic crisis by creating opportunities through the 'Together We Are Building Egypt' campaign.
Ali stressed that Egypt would not be dragged into violence like Iraq and Pakistan, despite attempts by some in the country to spread chaos.
"I know some young people would like us to respond against those who use violence; however, the wise person forces his plan on his enemies and does not follow their agenda."
At least 59 people have been killed and hundreds injured in nationwide protests since the second anniversary of the January 25 Revolution. A number of state and FJP buildings have been attacked.
'Together We Are Building Egypt' is the Muslim Brotherhood's project to mark the second anniversary of the revolution.
