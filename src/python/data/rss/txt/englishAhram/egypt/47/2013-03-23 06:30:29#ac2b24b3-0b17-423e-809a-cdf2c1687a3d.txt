Kidnappers of tourists hiding in North Sinai's Maghara: Military source
Military confirms tracking down place of kidnappers, search still underway
Kidnappers of the two tourists have head to the Maghara district in North Sinai, said a military source in the third army to Ahram Arabic website.
He also confirmed they are currently coordinating with the second army to track them down.
Two tourists were kidnapped in South Sinai on Friday. The assailants according to reports want to trade the hostages, one Norwegian and one Arab Israeli, for an imprisoned relative accused of drugs offences.
The masked gunmen stopped the tourists' car on the road between Nuweiba and Dahab on Sinai's eastern coast, forcing the foreigners to switch to their pickup truck.
The military source further added that General Osama Askar, head of the third army has intensified forces to protect banks and post offices in Ras Sidr after receiving reports that security responsible for their protection have withdrawn.
Sinai has been experiencing a chronic security vacuum since the 2011 revolution. Kidnapping of tourists have also increased significantly.
Hostages are in most cases released after a few hours of being abducted without being hurt.
