Islamists to demonstrate against 'bias' at Egyptian Media City
Islamists groups and activists make online calls for another protest at the EPMC against "biased" media coverage
About 200 people were injured when anti-Brotherhood protesters clashed with
members of the group at the Brotherhood's headquarters in Moqattam, Cairo, and stormed a number of its offices across the country.
The clashes have sparked anger among Islamist groups online, which claimed that some media channels were biased and in turn called for "besieging" the EMPC on Sunday.
The groups are particularly critical of the coverage of TV channels ONTV, owned by businessman and founder of the liberal Free Egyptians Party Naguib Sawiris, CBC and Al-Nahar, both owned by business tycoon Mohamed Al-Amin, and Al-Hayat, owned by head of Al-Wafd opposition party El-Sayed El-Badawi.
The groups called these channels ones of "sedition" in a Facebook event.  
Prominent Islamist activists have also expressed their support for the demonstration on social media websites.
Controversial Islamist activist Abdel-Rahman Ezz said on his official page on Twitter that "the rest of the Islamist revolutionary movements" should join the protest.
Several activists online have also started organising transportation for supporters of the demonstration to the EMPC in 6 of October city on the outskirts of Cairo, while others have called for taking more violent measures such as storming into the building.
Islamists staged a sit-in last December at the EMPC also to protest against "biased" media coverage of several liberal and independent channels and called for "reforming the media."
