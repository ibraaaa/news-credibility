Parties who boycotted Morsi's national dialogue invited to send suggestions
The presidential office is compiling a report of suggestions received from political groups on ensuring the transparency of the upcoming parliamentary elections
The office of Egypt's president announced on Tuesday evening that it will continue to receive proposals from the political parties who did not participate in Tuesday's national dialogue meeting with President Mohamed Morsi.
Morsi conducted the first session of his 'national dialogue' initiative with representatives of political parties and groups to discuss guarantees for free and fair parliamentary elections due to begin on 22 April.
The presidency will present a detailed report on the recommendations of the national dialogue to the High Elections Committee. A presidential spokesman said that the office is currently compiling a report with all suggestions given, as well as a number of proposals from political parties who did not participate in the meeting.
A number of opposition figures and parties boycotted Tuesday's dialogue session, including the liberal Constitution Party, the Popular Socialist Alliance Party, the Egyptian Social Democratic Party and the Wafd Party.
A number of public figures also declined the invitation to attend the meeting, including activists Gamal Eid, Abdel-Rahman Youssef, Mostafa El-Naggar and Wael Ghoneim.
The moderate-Islamist Strong Egypt Party also boycotted Tuesday's session, stating: "The presidency insists on issuing important decisions unilaterally without any social or political discussion with other political powers."
The party nevertheless sent a list of 20 recommendations to the presidency regarding upcoming the parliamentary polls. 
The 13 political parties that accepted the president's invitation to hold talks on Tuesday included the Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party (FJP); the Salafist Watan Party; the Salafist Nour Party; the moderate-Islamist Hadara Party; the moderate-Islamist Wasat Party; Al-Gamaa Al-Islamiya's Building and Development Party; and the liberal Ghad El-Thawra Party.
