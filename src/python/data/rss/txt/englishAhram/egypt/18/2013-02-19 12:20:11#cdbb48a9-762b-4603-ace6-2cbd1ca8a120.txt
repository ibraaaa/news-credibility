Uneasy calm in Mahalla Egypt after a night of renewed clashes
Clashes renewed for the fourth consecutive day between anti-Morsi protesters and police Monday night in the Nile Delta governorate, subsided Tuesday morning
Uneasy clam has descended Tuesday morning on the city of Mahalla, in the Nile Delta, after clashes renewed Monday night for a fourth day.
Protesters converging at a local police station in Gharbiya governorate threw stones and Molotov cocktail. In response police fired tear gas, reports Al-Ahram Arabic news website.
According to a health ministry source, no injuries were reported.
Meanwhile, security forces and protesters clashed back and forth in Shoun Square, with protesters setting fire to tyres and throwing stones at police.
Earlier on Friday, clashes erupted in several cities across the governorate of Gharbiya as protesters held rallies to demand justice for slain political activist Mohamed El-Gendy, whom they say was tortured to death while in police custody. One was reported killed in the day and 20 arrested on charges of attacking the governorate's administration building.
Clashes ensued late Sunday and continued until dawn Monday in the Nile Delta industrial city of Mahalla with police firing teargas at dozens of stone-throwing protesters.
Six protesters were arrested in the wake of Sunday clashes. 
The city has seen on-going protests since the second anniversary of Egypt's uprising, January 25.
