Egyptian court orders return of 'bearded policemen' to duties
Egypt's 'bearded policemen' are ordered to get back to work by court order after being suspended by interior ministry for breaking police code
An Egyptian court has said that a group of policemen suspended from duties for growing beards must be allowed to return to work.
The Supreme Administrative Court on Wednesday ordered the return of the 'bearded policemen' to their work, after they were suspended for growing beards.
Police officers in Egypt are not allowed to grow full beards. However, a group of policemen defied the law, saying it is their "right to grow beards," as a sign of Muslim piety.
The interior ministry suspended them as a result, which prompted the "bearded policemen's coalition" to embark on protests.
The emergence of bearded policemen in Egypt caused controversy when they started appearing after the parliamentary elections in 2012. The group stressed, however, that are not allied with any particular Islamic trend or political party.
