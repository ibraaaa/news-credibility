Egypt's Popular Current to mourn dead activist El-Gendy Sunday
The Egyptian Popular Current calls for a moment of silence on Qasr El-Nil Bridge Sunday for Mohamed El-Gendy, allegedly tortured to death by police last week
A moment of silence for slain activist and member of the Popular Current, Mohamed El-Gendy, is to take place Sunday on Qasr El-Nil Bridge near Tahrir Square.
El-Gendy was reported dead Monday after having been allegedly tortured by police following his arrest during 27 January clashes near Tahrir Square.
On Tuesday, Emad El-Deeb deputy head of the chief coroner’s office, told Al-Ahram Arabic news website that forensic authorities have discovered that El-Gendy’s death was due to head trauma that led to a brain hemorrhage.
Later on Wednesday, Chief Coroner Alaa El-Asasi told
Al-Shorouk
newspaper that El-Gendy’s death was not due to torture but rather a result of his body crashing into a solid surface causing fractures in his skull and rib cage in addition of internal bleeding in his brain, chest and lungs.
Meanwhile, two security sources told Reuters Tuesday that the young activist was beaten unconscious while under interrogation at a security camp where he was detained for three days.
The Ministry of Interior denied accusations that El-Gendy was tortured, saying in its report on the matter that he was found injured on the street after he was hit by a car 28 January, and was taken to Cairo's Hilal Hospital where he died some days later.
