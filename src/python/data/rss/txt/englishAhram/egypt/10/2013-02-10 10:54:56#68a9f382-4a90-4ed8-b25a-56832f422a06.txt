Appeal against Battle of Camel acquittals' verdict in May
Court sets 8 May for session to hear appeal of acquittal of 25 Mubarak-era officials accused of 'orchestrating' the infamous deadly attack on protesters during the Jan 25 uprising
Egypt's Court of Cassation has scheduled 8 May to examine the appeal filed by the prosecution against the acquittal of a group of Mubarak-era officials who were accused of perpetrating the deadliest attack on Tahrir Square protesters during the 18 days of the 25 January uprising.
On 10 October, a Cairo criminal court acquitted all 25 accused defendants in the infamous 2 February, 2011 "Battle of the Camel" attack on Tahrir Square at the outbreak of the Egyptian revolution.
The verdict prompted public uproar, and mass protests called on Egyptian president Mohamed Morsi to intervene and order a retrial.
State prosecutors came under fire by many Egyptians for allegedly failing to provide adequate evidence to convict the defendants.
Prosecution officially filed an appeal on 19 December. 
Former Parliament Speaker Ahmed Fathi Sorour, former head of the Shura Council Safwat El-Sherif, and former Minister of Manpower Aisha Abdel-Hadi were among the defendants in the case.
During the battle, pro-Mubarak thugs stormed Tahrir Square on camels and horses, killing 11 protesters and injuring more than 2000. Unknown snipers, who were reportedly deployed on the top of surrounding buildings, also shot at the demonstrators.
