Egypt's Upper House of Parliament acknowledges all reservations made by High Constitutional Court (HCC) over draft parliamentary elections law
Egypt's Shura Council, the upper house of parliament currently endowed with legislative powers, announced on Thursday afternoon it has agreed to the reservations made by the High Constitutional Court (HCC) over the electoral law set to regulate the parliamentary elections due in the spring of 2013.
On Monday, the HCC decided that as many as 10 articles of two draft laws regulating parliamentary polls run counter to the newly-approved constitution. 
Head of the Shura Council Ahmed Fahmi, of the ruling Freedom and Justice Party, said the council has taken into account the rejections made by the HCC and that he had acknowledged all observations.
