Gamaa Islamiya calls for peaceful methods to attain revolution demands
Egypt's Jan 25 Revolution goals should be met without violence, urges Gamaa Islamiya and its Construction and Development Party on Mubarak ouster anniversary
Egypt’s Gamaa Islamiya and its Construction and Development Party have called for the fulfilment of the January 25 Revolution's goals away from violence in a Monday statement, marking the anniversary of ousted president Hosni Mubarak's departure.
"Mubarak's step down came as a result of sacrifices made by the revolution's youths and an accumulation of efforts by the Islamist movement and nationalist forces,” read the statement.
The Islamist groups also called on the youth to "maintain peacefulness" while continuing in the revolution's path.
The groups criticised blocking metro railways and threatening and scaring passengers, referring to the protest that blocked Cairo's Sadat station in downtown earlier on Monday afternoon.
The Gamaa Islamiya finally called for people to celebrate Mubarak’s resignation oust in a "peaceful and civilised manner.”
Marking the anniversary of Mubarak's ouster, demonstrations marched on Monday to Cairo’s Tahrir Square and presidential palace, where violence was repeatedly witnessed during protests throughout the last week since the second anniversary of the January 25 revolution.
