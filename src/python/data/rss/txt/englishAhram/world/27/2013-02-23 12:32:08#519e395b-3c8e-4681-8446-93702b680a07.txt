Yemen troops shoot dead separatist in Aden clashes
A southern separatist is killed during clashes with Yemeni police in the city of Aden
Yemeni troops shot dead a southern separatist on Saturday in clashes that erupted when activists blocked roads during a protest in the main port city of Aden, medics and activists said.
"One man was killed and two others were wounded by gunfire," a medic at Aden's Al-Naqib hospital told AFP on condition of anonymity.
Activists from the separatist Southern Movement confirmed the victims belonged to their group which calls for autonomy or the complete independence of the south.
