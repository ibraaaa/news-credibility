Nearly as many Afghan troops killed in 1 year as NATO in 11
Nearly as many Afghan troops killed in one year as many as those of NATO deaths in past eleven years
Almost 3,000 Afghan police and soldiers have been killed in the last 12 months, nearly the same as the number of NATO deaths in Afghanistan in the last 11 years of war, Kabul said Wednesday.
In statistics marking the end of the lunar year in Afghanistan, the interior and defence ministries said 2,983 security personnel—1,800 police and 1,183 soldiers—lost their lives from March 2012 to March 2013.
According to the independent website, icasualties.org, 3,270 coalition troops, including 2,190 Americans, have died since the invasion started in late 2001.
Afghan police and soldiers have been set up and trained by NATO to take on increasing responsibility for security as NATO combat troops gradually withdraw from the country by the end of 2014.
Today numbered at 330,000 and due to reach a target of 352,000, they have been increasingly targeted by Taliban insurgents fighting to evict the Western-backed administration in Kabul.
"It is a pity but understandable why we have witnessed such a huge loss of life and increase in ANSF (Afghan security force) casualties since they started taking responsibility from international troops," said analyst Jawed Kohistani.
"Given the fact that there has not been any effective strategy from the Afghan defence or interior ministries to deal with Taliban guerilla warfare tactics, we can expect more loss of life," he added.
In 2012, 402 NATO members died in Afghanistan, the lowest number since 2008.
