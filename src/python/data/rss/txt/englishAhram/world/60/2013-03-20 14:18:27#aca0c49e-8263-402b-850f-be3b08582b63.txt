US President Barack Obama lands in Israel for visit to smooth over past tensions
Barack Obama landed in Israel for the first time as US president on Wednesday, on a mission to ease past tensions with his hosts and hoping to paper over differences on handling Iran's nuclear threat.
Obama touched down aboard Air Force One at Tel Aviv airport, and was due to be met by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, President Shimon Peres and US ambassador to Israel Dan Shapiro, US officials said.
Israeli President Shimon Peres thanked Barack Obama for his "unshakeable" support as the US president arrived for his first visit to Israel since taking over the White House four years ago.
"A world without your friendship would invite aggression against Israel... In times of peace, in times of war, your support for Israel is unshakeable," he said.
