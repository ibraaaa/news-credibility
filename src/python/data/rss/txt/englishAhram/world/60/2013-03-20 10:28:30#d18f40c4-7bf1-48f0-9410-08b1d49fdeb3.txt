National Police Agency in South Korea investigates cyber attacks suspected to be committed by North Korea
 
South Korean police said Wednesday they were investigating reports from several major broadcasters and banks that their computer networks had come under a concerted cyber attack.
"Members of our cyber team are investigating this now," a National Police Agency spokesman told AFP.
Yonhap news agency said at least three broadcasters -- KBS, MBC and YTN -- and two banks reported that their computer networks had been paralysed, with the finger of suspicion likely to fall on North Korea.
