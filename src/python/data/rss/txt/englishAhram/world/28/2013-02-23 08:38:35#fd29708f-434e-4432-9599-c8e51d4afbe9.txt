At least 11 dead in clashes in southern Somalia: Witnesses
 
At least 11 people were killed in clashes between rival pro-government clan-based militias in the southern Somalia port of Kismayo on Saturday, witnesses said.
"I saw at least 11 people, especialy fighters, killed in these battles," a Kismayo elder, Mohamed Ga'al, told AFP, while Somali Prime Minister Abdi Said Shirdon called on the two clans to lay down their arms.
