Iraq governor wounded, two guards killed by suicide bomber
The governor of Iraq's restive Diyala province is wounded with two guards killed and six others injured in suicide car bombing
The governor of Iraq's restive Diyala province was wounded in a suicide car bombing Saturday while a provincial elections candidate was killed in another attack, according to reports.
The suicide bomber detonated an explosives-laden vehicle at Governor Omar Al-Humairi's house in Baquba, the capital of Diyala, wounding him, killing two of his guards and injuring six more, a police lieutenant colonel and doctor said.
Humairi, a member of the Iraqi Islamic Party, became governor of Diyala, a province that suffers frequent attacks by militants, in September.
No group has yet claimed responsibility for the attack.
Also on Saturday, Sheikh Hassan Hadi Al-Janabi, a provincial elections candidate in Babil province, was killed along with two of his relatives south of Baghdad by a magnetic "sticky bomb," a police captain and a doctor said.
While violence in Iraq has decreased significantly since its peak in 2006 and 2007, attacks remain commonplace.
