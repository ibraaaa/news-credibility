Israeli officer desecrates Quran in Al-Aqsa Mosque
In new reported provocative move that may trigger outrage, Al-Aqsa Mosque Foundation reports that Israeli soldier kicked and stepped on the Quran in one of Islam's holiest sites
An Israeli officer attacked Palestinian female students inside Al-Aqsa Mosque and desecrated a copy of the Holy Quran, according to Al-Aqsa Foundation for Endowment and Heritage.
"One of the Israeli officers located inside the courtyards of Al-Aqsa Mosque attacked two students from a girls' school near Buraq Mosque next to the Mughrabi Gate," the media department chief at the Foundation Mahmoud Abu Atta said.
Abul Atta quotes the girls' account that the officer tried to chase them away to prevent them from reciting the Quran. When they refused, the officer kicked and walked on a copy of the Holy Quran.
He said that a number of men and women gathered near the Mughrabi Gate to condemn the crim, chanting "God is great."
Al-Aqsa Foundation condemned the "heinous crime" against the students, blaming the Israeli occupation forces of the consequences of what might happen and called for prompt action to defend the sanctity of Al-Aqsa Mosque.
The Jerusalem-located Al-Aqsa mosque is the third holiest site in Islam. Israel's recurrent violations against the mosque have historically been a major source of tension and anger among Palestinians.
