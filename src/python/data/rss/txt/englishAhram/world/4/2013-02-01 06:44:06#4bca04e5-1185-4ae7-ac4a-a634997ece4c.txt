UPDATED: Bomber in U.S. Embassy attack in Turkey suspected leftist: TV
US embassy's suicide bomber suspected to be a member of a Marxist-Leninist group and a previous Turkish prisoner on terrorism-connected charges
Turkish police suspect the suicide bomber who attacked the U.S. Embassy on Friday, killing himself and a security guard, belonged to a far-left militant group, state broadcaster TRT said.
The bomber, about 30-years-old, used plastic explosives in the attack. He is believed to have spent time in prison on terrorism-related charges and was a member of the Revolutionary People's Liberation Party-Front (DHKP-C), TRT said.
The DHKP-C is a Marxist-Leninist group that has claimed responsibility for suicide bombings against police stations in recent years. There have been no claims of responsibility for Friday's attack.
