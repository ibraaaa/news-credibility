Breaking: Israeli army attacks Gaza, wounds three
Palestinian medical office says three farmers were wounded after Israel launched a military attack near Gaza border
Israeli tank fire wounded three Palestinians near central Gaza's border with the Jewish state on Friday, a Palestinian medical official said.
"Three farmers, around 20 years of age, were moderately wounded by a tank shell and taken to Shifa hospital in Gaza City," health ministry spokesman Ashraf al-Qudra told AFP, adding the men had been working in fields east of east of El-Bureij refugee camp when they were hurt.
An army spokeswoman said no such incident was known to the military.
Under the terms of a November ceasefire agreement between Israel and Gaza's Hamas rulers, Palestinians are supposed to have access to arable land in a buffer zone up to 100 metres (yards) from the border fence.
Israel says its soldiers open fire on Palestinians who come closer than that.
