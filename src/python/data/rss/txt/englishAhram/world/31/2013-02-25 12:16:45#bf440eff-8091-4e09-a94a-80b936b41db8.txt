UK asks for a full Israeli investigation into Garadat”s death
The united Kingdom repeats its call on Israel to limit 'administrative' detention of Palestinian prisoners
The UK has expressed its concern at the death of Arafat Gradat who died in Israeli detention last Saturday.
“It is important that the Israeli authorities conduct a full investigation into the circumstances of his death," a UK foreign Office spokesperson told Ahram Online. This investigation should include the Palestinian allegations of mistreatment of Garadat, he added.
Garadat”s family says their son, 30, died from torture in the Israeli Megiddo prison.
Israel Prison Service, however, says Garadat died because of what appeared to be a heart attack.
UK, a very close strategic ally to Israel, has repeatedly called on Israeli governments to “limit use of administrative detention and solitary confinement” against the Palestinians in the occupied West Bank.
“We have raised consistently with the Israeli authorities our concerns about the treatment of Palestinian detainees, including Israel’s extensive use of administrative detention and particular concerns around the detention of Palestinian children," the spokesperson said.
Last year, William Hague, the UK Foreign Secretary, has advised Israel to reinstate family visits for the Palestinian detainees.
The UK has also called on the Israeli authorities to ensure the detainees’ access to medical care of their choice.
“The latest incident only reinforces the need to resolve the issue of the Palestinian detainees currently on hunger strike without loss of life," the spokesperson said.
