UN says 20 peacekeepers detained on Golan Heights
UN peacekeepers posted at Golan Heights are held by fighters near Syrian border; UN officials dispatched to assess situation
The United Nations says about 20 peacekeepers in the force charged with monitoring the cease-fire between Israel and Syrian troops on the Golan Heights have been detained by approximately 30 armed fighters.
UN deputy spokesman Eduardo del Buey says the UN observers were on a regular supply mission Wednesday when they were stopped near an observation post which sustained damage and was evacuated last weekend following heavy combat.
He said the UN peacekeeping mission has dispatched a team to assess the situation and attempt a resolution.
