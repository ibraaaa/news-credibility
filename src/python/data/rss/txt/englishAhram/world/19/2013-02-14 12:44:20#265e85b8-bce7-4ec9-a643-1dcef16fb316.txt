IAEA, Iran talks fail again
IAEA fails again to reach a nuclear deal with Iran, with no specified date for another meeting
The chief UN atomic inspector said Thursday that talks with Iran had failed again to reach a deal on agreeing enhanced inspections of Tehran's nuclear programme, and that no new meeting had been set.
"We had discussions on the structured approach document but could not finalise the document," Herman Nackaerts of the International Atomic Energy Agency told reporters. "We haven't agreed yet on a date for the next meeting."
