Israel says it held Australian man under false name
Israel is admitting for the first time that it held an Israeli with dual citizenship under a false name for security reasons.
According to a statement from the Justice Ministry, the prisoner's family was notified after he was detained.
The statement issued on Wednesday said he was imprisoned according to a court order and that the prisoner's full rights were retained.
It says the prisoner was found dead in his cell two years ago, and that a judge ordered an investigation into his death.
About six weeks ago, the investigation concluded that he committed suicide.
However, a judge has asked the state to check for possible aspects of negligence.
Australian media reported that an Australian-Israeli citizen was held in secret by Israel and died in 2010 under mysterious circumstances.
