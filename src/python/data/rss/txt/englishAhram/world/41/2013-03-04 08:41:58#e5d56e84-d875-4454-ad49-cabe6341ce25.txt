'Qaeda' suicide bomb kills 12 in Yemen: Witness, medics
Almost 12 people were killed after Al-Qaeda-suspected explosion occurred in southern Yemen
A suicide car bomb driven by a suspected Al-Qaeda militant on Monday rammed into a building in south Yemen used by pro-government militiamen killing 12 of them, a member of the group and medics said.
"A suicide car bomber from Al-Qaeda managed to reach the office of the Popular Resistance Committees in Loder, and detonated the explosives at the gate," said a member of the militia that have fought the Islamist militants alongside the army.
"Twelve bodies were brought to the morgue," said a medic at a local hospital.
