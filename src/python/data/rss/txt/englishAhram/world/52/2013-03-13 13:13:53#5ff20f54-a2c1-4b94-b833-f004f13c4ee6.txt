Messi and Pope
In Miami's Little Buenos Aires, Argentines broke out into cheers and applause as the new pope was announced.
"Long live Argentina!" some shouted. "God is Argentina!" cried others.
"We have Messi and we have the pope now," says Gabriela Pisquariello, an owner of the Buenos Aires Bakery & Cafe, referring to a star Argentine soccer player Lionel Messi.
