Israel launches military strikes on Syrian military near occupied Golan Heights
Israel has attacked Syrian military sites near the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, Egypt's state-run news agency MENA reported on Sunday.  
Israel's new Defence Minister Moshe Yaalon on Sunday vowed an "immediate" answer to all Syrian gunfire into the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, saying the Damascus regime was responsible.
"Every violation of Israeli sovereignty and shooting from the Syrian side will immediately be answered by silencing the source of fire," a statement quoted him as saying shortly after troops opened fire at a Syrian army post.
Further details will be provided shortly.
