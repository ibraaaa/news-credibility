Suicide attack kills 17 Pakistan soldiers: military
A suicide bomber rammed a water tanker bomb at a Pakistani check post late Saturday, killing 17 soldiers in the notorious tribal district of North Waziristan, the military said.
Officials initially said six soldiers were killed, but revised the death toll after daybreak.
The deaths were announced just hours before former military ruler Pervez Musharraf was due to return to Pakistan after more than four years in exile.
