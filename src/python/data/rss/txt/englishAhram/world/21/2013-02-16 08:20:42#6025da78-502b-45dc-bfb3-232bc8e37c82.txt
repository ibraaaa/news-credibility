Israeli army says it treated wounded Syrians
The Israeli military says that it treated five Syrians who had been wounded in fighting between government forces and rebels near security fence on the Golan Heights
Israeli soldiers treated five Syrians who had been wounded in fighting between Syrian government forces and rebels near Israel's security fence on the Golan Heights, the Israeli military said on Saturday.
The victims were taken to a hospital in Israel. The military did not say if they were combatants or civilians.
Syrian rebels earlier overran a military police checkpoint in Khan Arnabeh, a town in the Golan Heights near the ceasefire line along the demilitarised zone with Israel, a British-based violence monitoring group said.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the rebels seized weapons and a tank and the Syria army shelled villages inside the Israeli-Syrian ceasefire area.
It was not clear if the five Syrians being treated in Israel were wounded in that incident.
The Golan, which Israel seized from Syria in the 1967 Middle East War, has been largely untouched by the 23-month-old uprising in Syria. Israel has been on guard for violence spilling over or refugee influxes on the strategic plateau.
