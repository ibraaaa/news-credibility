Suicide bomber kills senior Iraqi army officer, guards
A suicide bomber killed a senior Iraqi army intelligence officer and three bodyguards on Saturday when he detonated his explosives at the officer's home in the northern city of Mosul, police said.
Iraq has seen an increase in suicide bombings since the start of the year as Sunni Islamist insurgents tied to al Qaeda try to ignite the kind of sectarian violence that pushed the country close to civil war in 2006-2007.
