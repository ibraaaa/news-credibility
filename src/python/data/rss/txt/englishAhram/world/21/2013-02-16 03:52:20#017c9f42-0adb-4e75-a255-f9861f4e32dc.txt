EU calls on Israel to respect rights of hunger strikers
The EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton calls on Israel to allow for the immediate restoration of hunger strikers' family visiting rights
The EU on Saturday called on Israel to respect its human rights obligations toward Palestinian prisoners, saying it was concerned about the deteriorating condition of four detainees who have been on a long-term hunger strike.
The European Union is "following with concern" the worsening health conditions of Samer Assawi, Jaafar Ezzedine, Ayman Sharawneh and Tareq Qaadan, who are all staging long-term hunger strikes, the bloc's foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton said in a statement.
"The EU calls on the government of Israel to allow for the immediate restoration of their family visiting rights and calls for the full respect of international human rights obligations towards all Palestinian detainees and prisoners," she said.
He comments came a day after clashes erupted in the occupied West Bank as thousands of Palestinian demonstrators staged a protest in support of the four.
