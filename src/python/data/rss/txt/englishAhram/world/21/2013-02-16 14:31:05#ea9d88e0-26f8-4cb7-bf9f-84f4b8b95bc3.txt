Four arrested after attack on Bahrain police: Official
Bahrain's interior ministry says it 'arrested four terrorists possessing weapons with which they had fired on security forces in Karzakan', a Shiite village southwest of Manama
Four people have been arrested in Bahrain after an overnight attack on security forces that wounded four policemen, including an officer, in a Shiite village, the authorities said on Saturday.
The unrest began on Friday when protesters blocked a highway linking a string of Shiite-populated villages with the capital, a day after clashes on the second anniversary of the Shiite-led uprising against the kingdom's Sunni rulers left two people dead.
The interior ministry said in a statement it had "arrested four terrorists possessing weapons with which they had fired on security forces in Karzakan," a Shiite village southwest of Manama.
A police officer and three policemen were taken to hospital after being wounded "by buckshot fired by a terrorist group," police chief Tarek al-Hassan said in statement.
The security forces "had to respond to the attack to defend themselves," Hassan added, without giving further details of the attack or the police response.
Bahrain has seen two years of political upheaval linked to opposition demands for a real constitutional monarchy, with the unrest claiming at least 80 lives, according to international rights groups.
A teenager and a policeman were killed when demonstrations on Thursday to coincide with the actual anniversary of the start of the uprising on February 14, 2011 turned violent.
Clashes raged sporadically in Shiite villages through the night and into the early hours of Friday.
The latest unrest comes amid a fresh round of a national dialogue between opposition groups and the government.
