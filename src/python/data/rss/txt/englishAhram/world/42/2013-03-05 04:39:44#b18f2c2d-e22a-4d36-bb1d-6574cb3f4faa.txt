North Korea vows to cancel Korean War cease-fire
North Korea threatens to cancel 1953 ceasefire which ended Korean war, amidst reports that Washington and Beijing have approved draft of punishing sanctions for UN Security Council resolution
North Korea vowed Tuesday to cancel the 1953 cease-fire that ended the Korean War, citing a US-led push for punishing UN sanctions over its recent nuclear test and ongoing US-South Korean joint military drills.
North Korea's Korean People's Army Supreme Command warned of stronger additional countermeasures in a statement that came amid reports that Washington and North Korean ally Beijing have approved a draft of punishing sanctions for a UN Security Council resolution responding to North Korea's 12 February nuclear test. The draft is expected to be circulated at the UN this week.
The United States and others worry that North Korea's third nuclear test pushes it a step closer toward its goal of having nuclear-armed missiles that can reach America, and condemn its rocket launches and nuclear tests as a dangerous threat to regional security.
North Korea says its nuclear program is a response to US hostility that dates back to the 1950-53 Korean War, which ended with an armistice, not a peace treaty, leaving the Korean Peninsula still technically in a state of war.
North Korea warned it will cancel the Korean War cease-fire agreement on 11 March, citing US-South Korean military drills that began 1 March.
North Korea said Washington and others are going beyond mere economic sanctions and expanding into blunt aggression and military acts. North Korea also warned that it will block a communications line between it and the United States at the border village separating the two Koreas.
