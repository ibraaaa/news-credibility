Obama to close Mideast trip with tour of Jordan's Petra
Obama is expected to fly to Petra, Jordan's fabled ancient city, in his final stop in the four-day trip to the Middle East
President Barack Obama is closing his four-day Mideast trip with a trek to Petra, Jordan's fabled ancient city.
Obama is expected to fly to Petra by helicopter from Jordan's capital city of Amman. A sudden sandstorm in the region scrambled some of Obama's travel plans Friday, leading the president to cautiously state that his trip to Petra was "weather permitting."
Obama's 24-hour visit to Jordan is his final stop in a four-day trip to the Middle East. It's the first foreign trip of the president's second term.
The bulk of Obama's time was spent in Israel, where he sought to reassure an anxious public that he is committed to their security. He also made a brief stop in the West Bank city of Ramallah for meetings with Palestinian leaders.
