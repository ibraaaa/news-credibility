Al-Assad's aunt, not mother, has passed away: Source
Syrian president's aunt, Fatma Makhlouf, has died in Dubai, official Syrian source says, dismissing reports that Assad's mother had passed away
The aunt of Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad, Fatma Makhlouf, has passed away in Dubai, an official Syrian source told Syrian news website Damas Post on Monday.
The source went on to deny recent speculation about the death in Dubai of Assad's mother, Anisa Makhlouf, describing the rumour as "completely false."
"The president's mother never left Syria in the first place," the source asserted.
In January, Syrian expatriates in the United Arab Emirates told AFP that Anisa had left the violence-wracked country and joined her daughter Bushra in Dubai.
Bushra's husband, General Assef Shawkat, an army deputy chief-of-staff, was killed along with three other high-ranking Syrian officials in the 18 July bombing of Syria's National Security Headquarters in Damascus.
In September of last year, Syrian residents of Dubai said that Bushra had enrolled her five children at a private school in the Gulf emirate, to which she had moved.
In March of last year, European Union member-states imposed sanctions on Assad's wife, mother, sister and sister-in-law in a bid to ratchet up pressure on the Syrian government.
The sanctions included asset freezes and bans on travel to EU states.
