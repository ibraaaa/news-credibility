BBC journalists go on strike over job cuts
BBC journalists go on strike for 24 hours in dispute over layoffs, potentially disrupting broadcaster's programming
BBC reporters have walked off the job for 24 hours to protest job cuts at the broadcaster.
Reporters mounted picket lines outside of the BBC's central London studios. Programs went on, but many shows were disrupted Monday.
Michelle Stanistreet, the National Union of Journalists general secretary, says poor decisions taken by the BBC leadership are leading to quality journalism being compromised.
The union says 2,000 jobs are at risk and that 7,000 jobs have been cut since 2004. It says members across the BBC, including the World Service, are at risk of compulsory redundancy.
The BBC said in a statement the union's actions are disappointing but that it doesn't change the fact that the corporation must make savings targets that will require job cuts.
