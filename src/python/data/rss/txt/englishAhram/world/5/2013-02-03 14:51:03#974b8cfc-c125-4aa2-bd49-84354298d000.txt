Turkey police arrest 11 over US woman's death: Report
Turkish police have arrested 11 people over the death of an American woman who disappeared while visiting Istanbul last month, local media reported Sunday.
The body of 33-year-old Sarai Sierra, a mother of two, was found on Saturday near Istanbul's ancient city walls with fatal head wounds, the Radikal daily reported.
Turkish police had been frantically searching for Sierra after her family reported that they had lost touch with her on January 21, the day she was due to return home to New York.
Police had initially detained a Turkish man named Taylan K., who is believed to be the last person to see Sierra before she went missing, but released him after questioning, according to local reports.
The two had reportedly met online four months ago.
