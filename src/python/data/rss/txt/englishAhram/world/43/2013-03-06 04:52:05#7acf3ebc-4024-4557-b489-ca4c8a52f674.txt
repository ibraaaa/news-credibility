No date decided for conclave to elect new pope
Vatican spokesman says no date specified for a conclave to choose the successor of Pope Benedict XVI
The Vatican on Wednesday said no date had been set for a conclave to elect a new pope and that all the 115 "cardinal electors" expected to take part in the vote will only be in Rome on Thursday.
"The date of the vote has not been decided," Vatican spokesman Federico Lombardi told reporters.
Lombardi also said Vietnamese cardinal Jean-Baptiste Pham Minh Man would be the last of the cardinal electors -- cardinals below the threshold age of 80 -- to arrive in Rome on Thursday.
"By tomorrow, all the cardinal electors should be in Rome," Lombardi said.
The conclave is due to be held in the first half of March following Benedict XVI's historic resignation.
