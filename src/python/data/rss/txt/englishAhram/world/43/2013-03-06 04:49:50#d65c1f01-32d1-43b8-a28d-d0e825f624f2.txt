Iraq attacks kill five
Three Iraqis were killed following an explosion in Anbar province
Attacks in a western province of Iraq killed three members of the security forces and two civilians on Wednesday, police and a doctor said.
Gunmen shot dead two police and two civilians west of Ramadi, the capital of Anbar province, while a national security force member was killed by a magnetic "sticky bomb," also west of the city, a police captain said.
The head of Ramadi Hospital's emergency department confirmed receiving five bodies.
The attacks came two days after a convoy carrying wounded Syrian soldiers who had been treated in Iraq to the border was ambushed in Anbar province, killing 48 Syrians and nine Iraqi guards, according to the defence ministry.
Violence has fallen considerably compared to five years ago, although deadly attacks in Iraq remain common, killing 220 people in February, according to an AFP tally based on security and medical sources.
