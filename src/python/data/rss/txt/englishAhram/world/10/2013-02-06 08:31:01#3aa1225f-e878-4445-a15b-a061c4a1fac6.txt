President Mohamed Morsi hosts tripartite meeting with Turkish and Iranian heads of state in sideline to OIC summit in Cairo
Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi started on Wednesday a tripartite meeting with his Iranian and Turkish counterparts, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Abdullah Gul consecutively, on the sidelines of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) summit in Cairo.
The summit brought together 26 Muslim heads of state out of the organisation's 57 member-states. President Morsi stressed that, day by day, the Muslim world was facing “new and pressing challenges” during his speech.
Political crises in Syria and Mali were expected to top the agenda of the OIC summit. Ahmadinejad’s visit marks the first trip by an Iranian head of state to Egypt since 1980.
