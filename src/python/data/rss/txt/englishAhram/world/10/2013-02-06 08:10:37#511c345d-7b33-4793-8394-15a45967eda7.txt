Abbas misnames President Morsi 'Mohamed Hosni' at OIC summit
Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas mistakenly refers to Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi as 'Mohamed Hosni' in summit speech in Cairo
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas mistakenly referred to Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi as "Mohamed Hosni" Wednesday during his speech to the summit of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) in Cairo.
Mohamed Hosni are first names of ousted dictator Hosni Mubarak and have been used in the street by opponents of Islamist rule in Egypt to equate Mohamed Morsi as president with the practices of Mubarak before him.
The summit brings together 26 Muslim heads of state out of the organisations 57 member-states.
During his speech, Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi described the resolution of the perennial Israel/Palestine issue as "the cornerstone of stability in the Middle East."
He went on to commend Palestinian success in winning non-member observer state status at the UN General Assembly last November, stressing that this achievement could not have been realised without joint cooperation.
