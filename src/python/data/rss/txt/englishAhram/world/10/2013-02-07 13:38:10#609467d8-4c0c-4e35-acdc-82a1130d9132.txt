Obama's second-term Cabinet takes shape
President Barack Obama has begun to reshape his Cabinet at the start of his second term, elevating several longtime advisers to key positions
More changes are still to come, as officials step down after long tenures through stressful periods at top jobs.
Obama has faced criticism for his choices, in part because of past policy decisions and statements some of them have made, but also because he has so far named four white men to a Cabinet once lauded for its diversity.
Following is a list of some Cabinet members who the White House has confirmed are staying on, and some positions that are vacant or may soon become vacant.
NOMINATIONS
* State - John Kerry, the unsuccessful 2004 Democratic presidential nominee and chairman of the powerful Senate Foreign Relations Committee, was confirmed by the Senate to replace Hillary Clinton.
* Treasury - Jack Lew, Obama's chief of staff and a two-time White House budget director, would take the top economic job at a time when the White House faces another round of tough negotiations on deficit issues with Congress. He would replace Timothy Geithner.
* Defense - Chuck Hagel is a former Republican U.S. senator and a decorated war veteran who fought in Vietnam. Hagel faces a tough confirmation battle because of past controversial comments about Israel and gays. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta is retiring.
* CIA director - John Brennan was Obama's counterterrorism adviser and has worked for the Central Intelligence Agency as officer, analyst and administrator. He would replace David Petraeus, who resigned in November over an extramarital affair.
* Chief of Staff - Obama tapped longtime foreign policy adviser Denis McDonough for the job.
STAYING PUT, FOR NOW
* Justice - Attorney General Eric Holder, who is part of an Obama task force looking at how to reduce gun violence, will stay on. There had been widespread speculation he would not serve more than four years, a rare long term for an attorney general.
* Homeland Security - Secretary Janet Napolitano had been expected to take over the Justice file if Holder left. Now that the White House has said Holder will stay, Napolitano is expected to remain in her current job.
* Agriculture - Secretary Tom Vilsack, who has spearheaded talks with Congress about cuts to farm subsidies, will stay on for Obama's second term.
* Health and Human Services - Secretary Kathleen Sebelius will remain in her job.
* Veterans Affairs - Secretary Eric Shinseki, a former U.S. Army chief of staff, will stay on.
* Education - Secretary Arne Duncan will stay in his job.

The announcement could still be a couple weeks away. Bob Perciasepe, Jackson's deputy and the EPA's acting administrator, is still in the mix, a source said.
