Syria's Assad supporters hack BBC Weather and Arabic Twitter account
The official BBC weather Twitter account and the BBC Arabic account are hijacked for almost three hours by supporters of Syria’s embattled president al-Assad
Several BBC Twitter accounts, including its weather, Arabic and Radio Ulster feeds have been hijacked by a group calling itself Syrian Electronic Army, the BBC said on its website.
A series of tweets about fake weather conditions in Middle Eastern countries began appearing on Thursday afternoon.
The accounts are the latest in a series of large corporate Twitter feeds to have been breached.
The BBC said that it was aware of the problem and was working on a fix.
