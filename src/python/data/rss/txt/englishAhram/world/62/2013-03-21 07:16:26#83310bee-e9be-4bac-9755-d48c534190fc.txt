Obama: Israel at a crossroads on peace
Peace with Palestinians is necessary for Israel to its own security, Obama says
US President Barack Obama warned on Thursday that Israel was at a "crossroads" and should choose peace with Palestinians because it was necessary for its own security and morally just.
"Today, Israel is at a crossroads," Obama said in a major speech in Jerusalem, adding that although Israelis felt safer under Iron Dome missile defences and barriers to thwart suicide bombers: "I believe peace is the only path to true security."
