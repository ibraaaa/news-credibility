Kurdish militant leader calls on fighters to leave Turkey
Let guns be silenced and politics dominate, says jailed Kurdish leader Abdullah Ocalan
Jailed Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan called on Thursday for his fighters to halt hostilities and withdraw from Turkey as part of a peace process which marks the best hope yet of ending a conflict that has killed 40,000 people.
"Let guns be silenced and politics dominate," Ocalan said in a statement read by a Kurdish politician at the Kurdish new year celebrations attended by a quarter of a million people.
"The stage has been reached where our armed forces should withdraw beyond the borders ... It's not the end, it's the start of a new era."
