Toll in Mexico fireworks explosion rises to 16
Authorities say 16 people died after fireworks exploded in a central Mexican village
The number of people killed when a small truck loaded with fireworks exploded during a religious procession in a central Mexican village rose to 16 Sunday, authorities said.
Scores more injured in Friday's tragedy were still being treated in hospitals, said a statement released by the Tlaxcala state government.
The document said a total of 154 people had been injured in the accident, of whom 72 remain hospitalized.
One witness said he saw "bodies flying" as people ran for cover after a stray firework landed on the truck in Jesus Tepactepec in the middle of a march for the village's patron saint.
Mexicans often set off fireworks during celebrations, but accidents have happened in the past due to the mishandling of the pyrotechnics or a lack of safety measures.
