Investigators summon Zambia's ex-president
Charges of corruption against Rupiah Banda are 'political strategy' say supporters
Zambian investigators on Saturday said they had summoned former president Rupiah Banda to appear for questioning, less than 24 hours after parliament voted to strip his immunity.
"The summons were delivered to him today," said investigations team spokesperson Namukolo Kasumpa, adding that Banda was due to appear at 10:00 am (0800 GMT) on Monday.
Banda faces charges of corruption, money laundering and fraud.
He ruled Zambia from 2008 to 2011, when he lost power to Michael Sata.
The handover was originally smooth, but Sata has since launched an anti-corruption fight perceived by many as a scheme to silence dissenting views.
Banda's lawyer Robert Amsterdam on Saturday described the case against the ex-president as "a farce that fails to pass the litmus test of legitimacy".
"Removal of Banda's immunity is totally unrelated to justice. It is a crass political strategy aimed at removing potential competitors to the successor of an ailing, enfeebled president," Amsterdam said.
