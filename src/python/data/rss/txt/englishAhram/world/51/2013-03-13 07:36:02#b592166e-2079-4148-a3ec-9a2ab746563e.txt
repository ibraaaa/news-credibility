Worldwide candlelight vigil for Syria on second anniversary of uprising
In Egypt, the vigil will take place in Mohandeseen in Cairo
In light of the second anniversary of the Syrian uprising, a number of charities are organising a candlelight vigil, which will take place across the world in support of the Syrian people.
The initiative, carried out by Save the Children and supported by Oxfam, aims to call on world leaders to act immediately in attempting to bring an end to the suffering of the Syrian people and get a peaceful resolution.
A virtual campaign has also been launched through the website Syriavigil.org, a social media platform which allows a single message to be shared en masse.
In Egypt, Oxfam Egypt has called for the candlelight vigil to take place outside Mostafa Mahmoud Mosque in the Mohandeseen district of Cairo on Thursday from 5 to 8pm.
The conflict in Syria, which is entering its third year, has claimed the lives of approximately 70,000 people, according to UN figures. The number of Syrian refugees has reached 1 million, with the largest numbers residing in Jordan, Turkey and Lebanon.
