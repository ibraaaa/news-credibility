UN: Mozambique floods displace 150k, leave 38 dead
UN will launch an appeal for $65 million in emergency aid after floods in the country displace thousands
A U.N. official in flood-hit Mozambique says the world body will launch an appeal for $65 million in aid after flood waters killed 38 people.
The U.N. says more than 150,000 have been displaced by flooding in the southern African nation of Mozambique over the last several days. Marie Conselee Mukangendo, of the U.N. children's agency UNICEF, said Tuesday the overall death toll stands at 38.
Mukangendo said the Chikahalani camp alone is holding an estimated 65,000 people but has only 28 latrines. She called the situation dire and said the U.N. would appeal for $65 million in relief aid on Wednesday.
Mozambique suffered record floods in 2000 that killed more than 700 people.
