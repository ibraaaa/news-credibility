Jordan government submits resignation after vote
Jordan's King Abdullah calls the cabinet to resume its work despite its resignation
Jordan's Prime Minister Abdullah Nsur submitted his cabinet's resignation to King Abdullah II on Tuesday, following a general election which was swept by pro-regime loyalists.
"Nsur submitted the resignation of the government to his majesty," a palace statement said.
"The king asked that the government continue to handle its responsibilities until the formation of a new government, which will take place following consultations with MPs."
The government usually quits after a parliamentary election, in line with a constitutional custom. Nsur formed his cabinet in October.
The final results published Monday of last week's general election showed tribal leaders, pro-regime loyalists and independent businessmen winning most of the seats after a boycott by the Muslim Brotherhood.
King Abdullah, who was Tuesday on a visit to Bahrain, hailed the election and thanked Jordanians for voting, vowing to pursue democratic reforms and reach out to groups like the Brotherhood.
"The success of our reform depends on a democratic approach that is built on the interaction and participation of all Jordanians in the process," the monarch said in a letter addressed to the nation on Tuesday.
"The new parliament should face national challenges through sustainable dialogue with all political and social powers."
Scoffing at the election, Islamists have said the king's plans for a parliamentary government fall far short of true democratic change and insist he should have no say in naming a premier.
