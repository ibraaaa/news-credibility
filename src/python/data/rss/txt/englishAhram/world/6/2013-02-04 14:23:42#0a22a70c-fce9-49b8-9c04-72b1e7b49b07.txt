Israel will 'regret aggression against Syria': Iran
Israel will regret its latest "aggression against Syria", a top Iranian official visiting Damascus told reporters on Monday.
"Just like it regretted all its wars... the Zionist entity will regret its aggression against Syria," said National Security Council head Said Jalili, a day after Israel implicitly confirmed it staged an air strike near Damascus last week.
