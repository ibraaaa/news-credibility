Opposition to take Syria seat at Arab League
The opposition will take over Syria's vacant seat at the Arab League, a high-ranking league official told AFP Monday, a day ahead of a leaders' summit in Doha. "The opposition has been invited to the Arab summit and will occupy Syria's seat at the Arab League," the official said requesting anonymity.
The opposition National Coalition announced that it would send interim prime minister Ghassan Hitto to the summit. The umbrella group's chief, Ahmed Moaz al-Khatib, quit on Sunday.
