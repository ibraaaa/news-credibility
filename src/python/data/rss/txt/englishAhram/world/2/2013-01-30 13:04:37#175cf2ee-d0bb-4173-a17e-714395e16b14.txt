End Syria war for sake of humanity: Ban Ki-Moon
Syria's situation is catastrophic and getting worse by the day, says UN chief Ban Ki-Moon at international Pledging Conference in Kuwait
The UN has pledged to not let the Syrian people down, describing the situation in Syria as "catastrophic and getting worse by the day," UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon said. Four million of the Syrian people are in immediate need.
Ban's remarks came during his speech at the Pledging Conference on Syria hosted by Kuwait on Wednesday.
"We are asking for $1.5 billion to fund our response to Syria’s humanitarian crisis, over the next six months, in two appeals focusing on the needs inside Syria and those of the refugees," he pleaded.
According to UN figures, at least 60,000 people have been killed during the last 22 months and ten per cent of all Syrians have fled from their homes inside the country. More than 700,000 have left Syria.
"About half the public hospitals and one quarter of the schools have been damaged," the UN chief added. Around 60 countries and tens of international and regional organizations and NGOs participated in the conference.
The international official reiterated that there is no military solution for the Syrian crisis. The bloodshed and misery will end only when there is a political solution, Ban said.
"The need for that solution becomes more urgent every day." He appealed to all sides, and particularly the Syrian government, to stop the killing. "In the name of humanity stop the violence."
Ban was very optimistic that the Kuwaiti conference will make commitments to help the Syrian people face their humanitarian crisis within next months."We must do more, and we must do it now...We cannot fail the Syrian people," he concluded. 
Kuwait has pledged $300 million to help the Syrian people face its escalating humanitarian crisis. This figure is about 20 per cent of the UN's call for up to $1.5 billion in international relief aid for Syria over the next six months.
