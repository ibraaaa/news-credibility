Kuwait court jails three opposition ex-MPs
A Kuwaiti court on Tuesday sentenced three former opposition MPs to three years in jail for criticising the emir in public, their lawyer said.
"The verdict against Khaled al-Tahus, Falah al-Sawwagh and Bader al-Dahum is three years each with immediate effect," Mohammad al-Jumia wrote on his Twitter account while attending the court session.
The three were arrested after making remarks at a public gathering on October 10 deemed offensive to the Gulf state's ruler Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Sabah. Tuesday's verdict is not final and can be challenged in the court of appeals and the supreme court.
