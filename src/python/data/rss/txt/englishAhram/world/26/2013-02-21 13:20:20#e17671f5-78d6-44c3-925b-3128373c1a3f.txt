Two killed in south Yemen clashes: Southern separatists
Two people were killed in Yemen following clashes between police and protesters
Two south Yemen separatists were killed on Thursday during clashes in Aden between police and members of the Southern Movement, a member of the group told AFP.
The police fired on protesters from the movement, thousands of whom had gathered in the southern port city to demand independence on the first anniversary of ex-president Ali Abdullah Saleh's ouster, Fathi Ben Lazraq said.
A rival rally was held in the same spot by members of the Islamist Al-Islah (reform) party, in support of unity.
