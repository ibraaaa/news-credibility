Russian embassy damaged in Damascus blast: Reports
The Russian embassy in Damascus faces damage after the deadly explosion in the Syrian capital
The windows of Russia's embassy in Damascus were blown out by the deadly blast in the Syrian capital Thursday but none of its staff were hurt, Russian news agencies reported.
The windows of the embassy were broken and it is currently being assessed if there was further damage, the Interfax and RIA-Novosti news agencies reported, quoting diplomats at the embassy which continued to work normally.
Russia is one of the few big powers to keep ties with the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad amid the conflict with rebels and retains a diplomatic presence in the centre of the Syrian capital.
