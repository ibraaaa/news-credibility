Palestinian detainee dies in custody in West Bank
Family of a man died on Friday in Palestinian custody in the West Bank says he suffered from high blood pressure and diabetes
A 40-year-old Palestinian man has died in Palestinian custody in the West Bank and authorities there have launched an investigation.
Human rights groups have complained of mistreatment of detainees in Palestinian lockups.
Ayman Abu-Sufian's family says he suffered from high blood pressure and diabetes. He died on Friday, two days after being detained on assault charges.
An official said Saturday that the Palestinian attorney general has launched an investigation. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to media.
Last week, a Palestinian detainee died in custody in Israel. Palestinian officials alleged that detainee was tortured, while Israel denied mistreatment and said more tests are needed to determine the cause of death.
The death of the 30-year-old man sparked protests in the West Bank.
