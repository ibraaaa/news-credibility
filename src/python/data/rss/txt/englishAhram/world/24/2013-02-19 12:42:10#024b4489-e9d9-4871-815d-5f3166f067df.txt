Turkish police raid leftist group after US embassy bombing
Following attack on US embassy in Ankara early February, Turkish police launch raids across Turkey, arresting 167 people in 28 provinces in an attempt to crackdown on militant leftist group behind attack
Police launched raids across Turkey early on Tuesday targeting a militant leftist group behind a suicide bomb attack on the US embassy, ordering the arrest of nearly 200 people, state-run Anatolian news agency reported.
The nationwide operation came after a member of the Revolutionary People's Liberation Party-Front (DHKP-C) blew himself up at an entrance of the US embassy in Ankara on 1 February, killing a Turkish security guard.
Anti-terror police arrested 15 people in the western coastal province of Izmir and two other provinces in operations targeting a group called the Revolutionary Civil Servant Movement, believed to be linked to the DHKP-C, Anatolian said.
It said police issued an order for the arrest of 167 people in 28 provinces across the country.
The DHKP-C, virulently anti-American and listed as a terrorist organisation by the United States and Turkey, has carried out a series of deadly attacks on police stations in the last six months.
The attack on the US embassy followed the detention of dozens of people in raids targeting people linked to the DHKP-C in January.
