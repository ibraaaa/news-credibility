14 Palestinians killed in Jordan road accident
On their way home to the West Bank from Saudi Arabia, 14 Palestinian pilgrims killed and 23 injured in a road accident in Jordan
Fourteen Palestinians were killed on Saturday and 32 injured, some seriously, when their bus collided head-on with a truck in Jordan, the emergency services in the kingdom said.
The passengers had been on the way home to the West Bank from Saudi Arabia where they had performed the Muslim minor pilgrimage or omra when the accident happened.
Their bus was in the Adssiyeh region in southwest Jordan when it was involved in a head-on collision with a truck before turning over, the sources said, adding that the driver of the other vehicle was also killed.
"Fourteen Palestinians were killed and 32 injured, and the number of fatalities could rise since several of those hurt suffered serious injuries," civil defence spokesman Colonel Farid al-Shareh said.
